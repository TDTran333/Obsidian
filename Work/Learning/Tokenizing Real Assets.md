# Tokenizing Real Assets
By now, Bitcoin and blockchain have become household words. Although many people mistakenly assume that they are synonyms, Bitcoin is merely an example of one of the first applications of blockchain technology.

The tokenization of real assets is another one. It potentially expands the investible universe for asset managers. It also increases liquidity of real assets that are currently considered to be illiquid and out of reach for most retail investors.

What started as an anarchistic attempt to remove financial institutions from the payments ecosystem, is now one of the biggest opportunities for substantial efficiency gains and new products/services, reaching far beyond the financial services industry.

## Evolution of Electronic Trading
### Bitcoin is to Blockchain what Outlook is to Internet
Blockchain is essentially a layer of infrastructure. It comprises many nodes, networks and interconnections that form the basis for administering, updating, and safeguarding the information that has been stored in what is essentially a big spreadsheet. 

The first application of the internet was email. The nodes and interconnections were used to send messages based on that infrastructure layer. 

The so-called payment coins were the first application of the blockchain infrastructure. These coins can be used to facilitate online payments, just as the name suggests.

### The Impact of Electronic Trading Has been Big
When trading migrated from physical to electronic marketplaces, many things changed. 
* **Trading costs came down** substantially because much of the paperwork was replaced by electronic record keeping. 
* **Access to global markets improved** because the physical location no longer mattered. 
* **Information asymmetry was reduced** substantially because the flow of information was also electronic instead of physical. 
* **Liquidity increased** because the facilitation of buy-and-sell orders had improved. 
* And finally, an **automated trading system** − now known as algorithmic trading – was developed on that infrastructure. 
	* One outcome of this system is that it enables high-frequency trading.

### Electronic Trading was First Developed for the Most Standardized Forms of Contracts
Buying a share is not the same as buying an entire company. Buying a commodity futures contract is not the same as buying that commodity. And yet, for many real assets the buying or selling is binary. Either you own the entire asset, or you don’t. This is where tokenization of real assets comes in.

Around 40 years ago, the term IPO (initial public offering) was used for the first time and now, it’s a well-known principle. In 2013 the ICO (initial coin offering) was introduced and it may also become as commonplace as the IPO over the next decade.

### Tokenization as the Next Step in Electronic Trading
In a nutshell, tokenization involves converting the partial or full ownership rights to an asset into a digital representation in the form of a token that is stored and administered on the blockchain.

## Using Technology to Create Liquid Markets
### The Tokenization via Blockchain Adds Efficiency
The tokenization process via a blockchain is more efficient than the current trading methods and it adds a global dimension to asset tradability. All the administration is documented on a blockchain and executed through smart contracts.

### Tokenizing the Income-Generating Real Estate
Investors could buy the digital tokens, thereby financing the project and receiving a right to the underlying revenue-pool of the property. Ownership is administered on the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts (a kind of automation software) handle the distribution of the rent income amongst token holders.

### Deciding if a Token Price is a Fair Representation of the Income Yield
Instead of deciding whether or not to buy an entire property, investors now have to determine if the price they would pay for a token is a fair representation of the income yield of the underlying property and the possibility of an increase in the asset’s value.

When the token is sold, merely the ownership of the token is transferred, not the entire underlying asset, as is the case with stock trading.

### Tokenizing Intangible Assets
Apart from tangible assets, investing in intangible assets such as copyrights, film-production rights, royalties, actors, etc., will also be possible. The methodology would be the same as with other real assets.

### Establishing Functioning Markets by Creating Arbitrage Opportunities
In order to establish a fair value through arbitrage possibilities that resemble structured finance solutions, the two-token waterfall framework by Lippiatt and Oved (September 2018) can be used. In this setting, the real asset is transferred to two separate tokens. One is senior in priority of payment, and it replicates debt. The other − junior in priority − replicates equity. In order to prevent arbitrage opportunities, the token value of both tokens must translate into the same real asset value.

### Tokenizing Liquid Assets
The same technology can be applied to equities and bonds. But this begs the question as to why people would invest in tokens and not in the mainstream equities. The key reason has to do with the infrastructure’s efficiency, besides the advantage of direct cash settlement when the tokens are accompanied by digital currency.

The added value of tokenizing liquid assets is currently rather limited, simply because the existing infrastructure is relatively efficient compared to market dynamics of real assets.

### Tokenization is not the Same as Securitization
The securitization of mortgage-backed securities brought liquidity, but the underlying exposure in the repackaged products could not be traced. Tokenization solves this, as there is always a link with the underlying asset.

### Effects of Tokenization on Asset Management
Financial institutions will need to redefine their activities. This will open up new business opportunities in the area of custody, the safekeeping of real assets, token advising and token investing. The impact on the asset management industry is likely to be considerable.

### Opportunity to Add Real Assets to Retail Retirement Portfolios
The shift from defined benefit to defined contribution pensions increases the need for diversification on a retail investor level.

For some larger financial institutions, like pension funds, the prospect of removing illiquidity might not be appealing, since these institutions benefit from the illiquidity premium. However, tokenization democratizes access to real assets and thereby caters to a different group of investors than it has done historically.

### Increasing the Investible Opportunity Set
The impact on theoretical asset pricing would also be profound, as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) − which includes all assets rather than just the smaller universe of liquid assets − will be expanded by a new investible opportunity set. This would have an impact on the relative risk of equity and bonds versus the opportunity set, and would therefore affect valuations, as well, by means of the discount rate adjustment.

### Consequences of Tokenization for Active Management in Equities
The opportunity set will expand to include private equities.

## Challenges to Overcome
Before tokenization can become the new normal in asset management, a couple of important hurdles need to be taken. Our expectation is that the roll-out will first take place in specific real asset class categories, like real-estate and arts. 

### Issues to be Resolved
#### Hurdles Related to the Token
The most important consideration here is the issue of ownership and its link with the underlying asset.

##### Ownership rights
* Does the token confer ownership rights?
* What happens when a token-owner has more than 51% of tokens?
* Do tokens confer voting rights?

##### Safekeeping of the link to the underlying asset
* How is the link between the token and the underlying asset secured?
* What happens if the link is broken?
* Who is ultimately responsible for ensuring there is a link to the underlying asset?

##### Cybersecurity
* What happens if tokens are stolen?
* How is key management facilitated?
* How is investor data safeguarded?

##### IT infrastructure
* What infrastructure protocol is used?
* Is there inter-operability between protocols?
* Will the IT infrastructure including smart contract overlays be audited?

#### Hurdles Related to the Asset
Underlying asset ownership rights and its maintenance are also important topics.

##### Ownership rights
* Who owns the underlying asset? How should majority stakes be dealt with?
* How are minority stakes protected?
* Does the owner, token holder or independent service provider make asset-related decisions?

##### Governance and maintenance
* Who maintains the underlying asset?
* Who governs/protects/verifies the underlying asset?
* Who is ultimately responsible for the underlying asset?

#### Hurdles with Respect to Regulation
Even if token- and asset-related hurdles are resolved by service providers, it is still not clear how the regulators would react to the token offering. 

First, regional standards are disappearing, because tokens are global in nature. Therefore, global cooperation among regulators would be required, and this process would take years to complete. In addition, the tax authorities would have to find a way to enable uniform treatment of tokens.

##### Reporting requirements and consumer protection
* What are the reporting requiremnts for tokens?
* What are the accounting standards/audit requirements?
* How are token-holders protected and what are their legal rights/obligation?

##### Tax implications
* Tangile/intangible assets treated differently for tax purposes
* Fungible/non fungible assets treated differently for tax purposes
* Movable/non movable assets treated differently for tax purposes

##### Oversight and regulatory mandates 
* Regulations are no longer regional, but global
* Who enforces rules and what is their mandate?
* Which autority assumes responsibility in case of disputes or misconduct?

### Conclusion
Real asset tokenization is an interesting innovation that follows in the footsteps of the introduction of blockchain technology in 2009. There are many potential benefits of tokenizing real assets. It would improve liquidity, expand the investible universe and create fractional ownership that provides options for better portfolio optimization. These benefits are not offered by the existing infrastructure – due to the local characteristics of the alternatives currently on offer and the inefficiencies related to those technological solutions. However, there are many hurdles that need to be cleared in order for tokens to become mainstream investment vehicles like the ones we are familiar with today.
