# Break-Even Cost of Mining a bitcoin
Fundstrat’s model incorporates three factors: the cost of equipment, electricity and other overhead such as maintaining cooling facilities.

Bitcoin mining today requires custom hardware that can cost several hundred to a few thousand dollars. And like much technology, more efficient equipment is always coming out. In fact, the need to regularly replace equipment accounts for more than half the cost of mining, according to Fundstrat’s model.

The cost to mine it varies widely around the world due to differing electricity costs. In the major bitcoin mining market of China, miners can access very cheap electricity produced by hydropower.

Chinese miners also have an incentive to produce bitcoin regardless of cost because it allows them to send money overseas and evade the government’s capital controls. Four out of the five largest bitcoin “mining pools” in the world are Chinese, according to data from Blockchain.
