# Proof of Work
Proof of work (PoW) describes a system that requires a not-insignificant but feasible amount of effort in order to deter frivolous or malicious uses of computing power.

Proof of work was initially created as a proposed solution to the growing problem of spam email.

### Key Takeaways
-   Proof of work (PoW) is a decentralized consensus mechanism that requires members of a network to expend effort solving an arbitrary mathematical puzzle to prevent anybody from gaming the system.
-   Proof of work is used widely in cryptocurrency mining, for validating transactions and mining new tokens.
-   Due to proof of work, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions can be processed peer-to-peer in a secure manner without the need for a trusted third party.
-   Proof of work at scale requires huge amounts of energy, which only increases as more miners join the network.
-   Proof of Stake (POS) was one of several novel consensus mechanisms created as an alternative to proof of work.

### Why Do Cryptocurrencies Need Proof of Work?
Because they are decentralized and peer-to-peer by design, blockchains such as cryptocurrency networks require some way of achieving both consensus and security.
Without a proof mechanism, the network and the data stored within it would be vulnerable to attack or theft.
