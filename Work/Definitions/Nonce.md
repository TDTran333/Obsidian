# What Is Nonce?
A nonce is an abbreviation for "number only used once," which is a number added to a hashed—or encrypted—block in a blockchain that, when rehashed, meets the difficulty level restrictions. The nonce is the number that blockchain miners are solving for. When the solution is found, the blockchain miners are offered cryptocurrency in exchange.

### Key Takeaways
-   Nonce, or a "number only used once," refers to the first number a blockchain miner needs to discover before solving for a block in the blockchain.
-   Once the mathematical computations are solved by the miner, they are gifted cryptocurrency for their time and skill.
-   Nonce is difficult to find and is considered a way to weed out the less talented crypto miners.
-   The world of crypto mining is challenging, and one often needs excellent computational power to even begin to try and solve the nonce.
