# NFT (non-fungible token) ELI5

## Fungibility
Fungibility is the ability of a good or asset to be interchanged with other individual goods or assets of the same type. Fungible assets simplify the exchange and trade processes, as fungibility implies equal value between the assets.

You can use blockchain technology to create a 'limited edition' version of a creative work that, because it's digital, would otherwise be infinitely reproducible.

In short, it's a way of applying some of the limited edition value of physical objects to the digital marketplace by creating an **artificial scarcity**.

The value of something lies in what you can get someone to pay for it, or what you'd pay to keep it. Nothing more or less.

### Blockchain memory

The point of blockchain tech is to prevent people from modifying the history of the ledger, so that everyone on the network agrees on the same history for the ledger.

The whole world has proof that someone who has access to the bitcoin address 12345 has exactly 1 bitcoin. But in order to do anything with that bitcoin, you need to prove that you are the legitimate person to whom that address belongs.

Think of it being similar to a safety deposit box, but that there's a public record of what's been put in there. If you lose your bitcoin wallet you've effectively lost the keys to that safety deposit box. Everyone can see what's been put in there, but without the key it's inaccessible. Forever.

### Harshing
Hashing is a process where you take a piece of data and "scramble" it so that you can't figure out the original data from the scrambled one. Hashing is also consistent, so you will always get the same scrambled data from the original data.

SHA256 is a common method used to scramble data (this is called a "hashing algorithm").

### High Energy Consumption
Many blockchains uses Proof of Work as a consensus mechanism in order to avoid flaws like someone being able to double-spend tokens, or create more tokens for themselves out of nothing. The system is made in such a way that if someone wants to do these kinds of exploits, they need to have more processing power than the entire rest of the network combined. Therefore, the more processing power is in a network, the more secure it is, and therefore there are financial incentives to dedicate processing power for this purpose. So a lot of people do it. And processing power requires a lot of energy.

### High CO2 Production
The process of mining requires very heavy computation. It's a bit like brute-force cracking a code by trying every possible combimation. This is usually done on GPUs because of their massive computational power and ability to process things in parallel. All this processing consumes a lot of electricity.

And that's not all, those devices produce a lot of heat too. So mining rigs will require industrial-scale cooling systems to keep the processing units from overheating and catching fire. This adds considerable energy expenditure.

All this energy being consumed is redundant. And most of the planet's electrical grid today still relies on coal/gas/oil/fuel, and all of these produce CO2.
