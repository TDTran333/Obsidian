# The New York Times just sold an NFT for more than half a million dollars

From NYT article:
An NFT, in layman’s terms, is a new kind of digital collectible item that is stamped with a unique bit of code that serves as a permanent record of its authenticity and is stored on a blockchain, the distributed ledger system that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These collectibles can be bought and sold like trading cards, and the nature of blockchain technology means that once a token is created, it can’t be deleted or counterfeited. That makes it useful for artists, musicians and others who want to create limited edition digital goods.

As with all NFT sales, you’ll get the token itself — a unique digital collectible that corresponds to an image of this column in PNG format. (Our lawyers want me to note that the NFT does not include the copyright to the article or any reproduction or syndication rights.)

But if they stick around, NFTs could transform the way digital goods are created, consumed and traded online.

NFT gives the owner bragging rights, the underlying digital media can still be freely copied.

NFT does not give owners control of the works. Digital copies can still be made of the work. Only the NFT can't be copied, which serves merely as a certificate of authenticity.
