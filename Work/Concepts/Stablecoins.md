## What Is a Stablecoin?

A stablecoin is a new class of [cryptocurrencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) that attempts to offer price stability and are backed by a [reserve asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reserve-assets.asp). Stablecoins have gained traction as they attempt to offer the best of both worlds—the instant processing and security or privacy of payments of cryptocurrencies, and the volatility-free stable valuations of [fiat currencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp).

### Key Takeaways

-   Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that attempt to peg their market value to some external reference.
-   Stablecoins may be pegged to a currency like the U.S. dollar or to a commodity's price such as gold.
-   Stablecoins achieve their price stability via collateralization (backing) or through algorithmic mechanisms of buying and selling the reference asset or its derivatives.
