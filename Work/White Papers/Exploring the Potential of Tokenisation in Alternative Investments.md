# Exploring the Potential of Tokenisation in Alternative Investments
Retail investors increasingly understand the risk profile associated with alternative investments and are interested in actively allocating to them. They are also more willing to lock up their capital for the longer term. However, the reality is that, generally, only accredited investors are allowed access to these investments, leaving retail investors with no entry point. Essentially, access to alternative investments depends on the individual’s net worth, and with the current level of net worth required, retail investors generally miss out.

### TOKENISATION
**Tokenisation is the digitalisation of an asset using blockchain technology.** The underlying asset could be a traditional asset class (like a stock or a bond) or an alternative asset class investment (like private equity or real estate).

To better understand the topic of tokenisation, CAIA partnered with Liquefy, a leading tokenisation solutions expert, and BNP Paribas Asset Management, one of the world’s largest asset managers, in **[a white paper on Tokenisation of Alternative Investments](https://caia.org/sites/default/files/2021-02/CAIA_Tokenisation_of_Alternatives.pdf)**. Our aim was to explore the application of tokenisation across the broad spectrum of alternative investments. We also identified the benefits and the challenges of applying tokenisation in each of the alternative asset classes.

### WIDENING ACCESS
A key benefit of tokenisation is **fractionalization**. This allows for the ownership of an underlying asset to be split across many investors. Each investor then benefits according to the proportion that they own. Fractionalisation allows for previously high-ticket investments to be portioned into much more accessible ticket sizes. 

In addition, there are other potential benefits such as more efficient processes and lowering of administrative cost which bode favourably to all investors.
