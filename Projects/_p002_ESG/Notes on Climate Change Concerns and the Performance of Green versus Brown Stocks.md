Do increases in concerns about climate change affect the performance of green vs. brown stocks?

Related to Pastor et al (2020)

Their model predicts:
Brown firms stocks outperform green firms stocks in long run
Green firms stocks outperform brown oens when climate changes strengthen unexpectly due to:
	Change in green firms expected cash-flows
	Change in investor tastes regarding sustainable investments
	
We empirically test the predictions and show that:
The stock returns of green firms tend to outperform when concern increase unexpectly
Relationship between climate change concerns and stock market can be linked to the cash-flow channel and the taste channel

Our results suggest
Investors tend to use brown firms screening strategy
Within-industry greeness matters
	It does matter
Firms that do not disclose greenhouseg  gas emissions level are also exposed to concerns
There is inefficiency in price move due to concerns

We propose a daily media based index in term of climate change concerns

#### Outline of paper

To study the model, we need to measure unexpected changes in climate change concerns

Issue: Yearly data, not practical 

#### We propose new medias data as proxy :

#### Media Influence on Perception and Concerns:

News sources from very high circulation US newspaper
2003 - 2018

#### Definition of Concerns to generate a concern score

Aggregation

By day and by source, we compute the sum of concerns scores accrotes the climate change related articles

Standardize series by source

We then aggregate

We estimater an AR(1) model to estimate the MCCC index over 2003 to 2009
Get the residuals to obtain a proxy of unexpected changes
We refer to the redisuals as UMCt
