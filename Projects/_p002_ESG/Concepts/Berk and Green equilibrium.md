## Abstract

We derive a parsimonious rational model of active portfolio management that reproduces many regularities widely regarded as anomalous. Fund flows rationally respond to past performance in the model eventhough performance is not persistent and investments with active man-agers do not outperform passive benchmarks on average. The lack ofpersistence  in  returns  does  not  imply  that  differential  ability across managers is nonexistent or unrewarded or that gathering information about performance is socially wasteful. The model can quantitatively reproduce  many  salient features in  the data. The flow-performance relationship is consistent with high average levels of skills and consid-erable heterogeneity across managers.

> The BG model implies that larger and older funds should exhibit lower alphas because they have presumably grown (or survived) to the point where they provide no superior alphas, net of fees—partly due to flows that followed past superior performance. Smaller and newer funds, on the other hand, may exhibit some skills before investors learn about their superior abilities.

> Perhaps more directly, the BG model also implies that flows should disproportionately move to truly skilled funds, and that these funds should exhibit the largest reduction in future skills.
