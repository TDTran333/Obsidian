Eligible Investors: These are investors who meet certain income/net worth criteria as set by regulators and who have:

* Financial assets worth at least $400,000 (individual or couple)
* Net income exceeding $75,000 (individual) or $125,000 (couple)

In some cases, less affluent investors can buy a limited amount of exempt investments under what is known as an “offering memorandum.” An offering memorandum is a ‘lighter’ version of a prospectus and a company can make this available so they can sell to a wider pool of investors who are referred to as either “eligible” or “ineligible” investors.

Eligible Investors are allowed to purchase exempt investments with a maximum investment limit of $30,000 per year or up to $100,000 if they receive advice from a portfolio manager that the investment is suitable. Ineligible Investors are limited to a maximum of $10,000 investment through the offering memorandum exception rules.
