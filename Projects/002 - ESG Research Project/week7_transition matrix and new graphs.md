## Analysis for week 7
* Backward-looking analysis is for manager selection and performance ex-post
* Forward-looking analysis is for scope of skills
	* Ideally, we want to see Green has more scope for outperformance

## To do
- [x] Clean code even more
- [x] Redo rmd file
- [x] [[Transition Matrix]]
- [ ] Verify reference code
- [ ] Verify graph
- [ ] Looping analysis
	- [ ] Run analysis with buckets of 5 firms per bucket
	- [ ] Capture all the years
	- [ ] Modify the lambda parameter
	- [ ] Modify the hac option
	- [ ] Save graph to png automatically
	- [ ] Calculate % of outperformance over time

### Notes
* Figure out how to calculate the transition matrix
* Figure out how to generate buckets for analysis
* Figure out how to loop the analysis

### Issues
Erroneous prices and returns
