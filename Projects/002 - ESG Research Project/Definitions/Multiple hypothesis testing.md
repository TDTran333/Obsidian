From Wikipedia
Multiple comparisons arise when a statistical analysis involves multiple simultaneous statistical tests, each of which has a potential to produce a "discovery", of the same dataset or dependent datasets. A stated confidence level generally applies only to each test considered individually, but often it is desirable to have a confidence level for the whole family of simultaneous tests.

For example, if one test is performed at the 5% level and the corresponding null hypothesis is true, there is only a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. However, if 100 tests are conducted and all corresponding null hypotheses are true, the expected number of incorrect rejections (also known as false positives or Type I errors) is 5. If the tests are statistically independent from each other, the probability of at least one incorrect rejection is 99.4%. 

From springer

Definition. The multiple hypothesis testing problem occurs when a number of individual hypothesis tests are considered simultaneously. In this case, the significance or the error rate of individual tests no longer represents the error rate of the combined set of tests.

In conventional hypothesis testing, the level of significance or type I error rate (the probability of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis) for a single test is less than the probability of making an error on at least one test in a multiple hypothesis testing situation. While this is typically not an issue when testing a small number of preplanned hypotheses, the likelihood of making false discoveries is greatly increased when there are large numbers of unplanned or exploratory tests conducted based on the significance level or type I error rate from a single test.

In other words

Multiple testing refers to any instance that involves the simultaneous testing of more than one hypothesis. If decisions about the individual hypotheses are based on the unadjusted marginal p-values, then there is typically a large probability that some of the true null hypotheses will be rejected.
