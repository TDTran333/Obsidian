### Following is a summary of their key conclusions:

* Firms differ in the sustainability of their activities. “Green” firms generate positive externalities on society, “brown” firms generate negative externalities, and there are different shades of green and brown.

* Agents differ in their preferences for sustainability, or “ESG preferences.” These preferences have two dimensions. Agents derive utility from holdings of green firms and disutility from holdings of brown firms. Second, though they care about firms’ aggregate social impact, they also care about financial wealth. However, they are willing to sacrifice some expected return in exchange for the utility benefits provided by green investing.

* Agents’ tastes for green holdings affect asset prices – the greener the asset, the lower its capital asset pricing model (CAPM) alpha in equilibrium. Green assets have negative alphas and brown assets have positive alphas. Consequently, agents with stronger ESG preferences, whose portfolios tilt more toward green assets and away from brown assets, earn lower expected returns.

* Sustainable investing leads to positive social impact through its impact on asset prices. By pushing green asset prices up (lowering the cost of capital) and brown ones down (raising the cost of capital), agents’ tastes for green holdings induce more investment by green firms and less investment by brown firms. The more agents care more about ESG, the greater the positive social impact.

* If ESG concerns strengthen unexpectedly, green assets can outperform brown assets despite having lower expected returns. The higher short-term returns are a result of the increased cash flows on valuations. “Exposure to ESG risk is why green assets may outperform brown assets over a period of time.” Investor tastes/preferences can drive short-term returns through changes in valuations. Thus, the premium induced by exposure to the ESG risk factor can be large enough to overcome green stocks’ negative alphas.

* There is an ESG risk factor as the strength of ESG concerns can change over time, both for investors in firms’ shares and for the customers who buy the firms’ goods and services. If ESG concerns strengthen, customers may shift their demands for goods and services to greener providers (the “customer” channel), and investors may derive more utility from holding the stocks of greener firms (the “investor” channel). Greener stocks are more exposed to the ESG risk factor.
