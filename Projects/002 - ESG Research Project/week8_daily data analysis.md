## Analysis for week 8
We didn't see a clear results based on last week's monthly analysis.
We are moving to daily analysis. The key question is what do we want to capture?
What's the plan B if the results aren't good or useful?

## To do
- [x] Averages
- [x] Plots over time
- [ ] Correlation histograms
- [ ]  [[Concordant]] observations histograms
- [x]  Daily results
- [x] Analysis and summary of results in powerpoint
