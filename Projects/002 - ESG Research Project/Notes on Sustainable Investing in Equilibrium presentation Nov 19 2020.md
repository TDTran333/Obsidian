## Sustainable Investing in Equilibrium

Presented by: Lubos Pastor
1h30 presentation

### Abstract
We present a model of investing based on environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) criteria. In equilibrium, green assets have negative CAPM alphas,
whereas brown assets have positive alphas. Green assets' negative alphas stem
from investors' preference for green holdings and from green stocks' ability to
hedge climate risk. Green assets can nevertheless outperform brown ones during
good performance of the ESG factor, which captures shifts in customers' tastes
for green products and investors' tastes for green holdings. The latter tastes produce positive social impact by making firms greener and shifting real investment
from brown to green firms. The ESG investment industry is at its largest, and
the alphas of ESG-motivated investors are at their lowest, when there is large
dispersion in investors' ESG preferences.

Sustainable investing
Objectives: Finance + ESG

Example: Blackrock beliefs

General equilibrium model
* Simple model, tractable

Analyze financial and real effects
* Effects on asset prices, society

### Main Theoretical Results

Greener assets have lower expected returns
* Agents have green tastes & green assets hedge climate risk
* Green assets have negative alphas, brown assets have positive alphas

Greener assets outperform when ESG factor performs well
* ESG factor captures shifts in customers' and investors' tastes
	* Unexpected shift in taste
	* Green assets have positive beta to ESG factors
* Two-factor pricing : Market + ESG factor

ESG-motivated investors earn lower expected returns
* But they earn an "investor surplus"

ESG industry's size increases with dispersion in ESG preferences
* About how disperse our taste about ESG are

Sustainable investing leads to positive social impact
* Green firms invest more, brown firms less
* Firms become greener

**This is all theory**

If ESG become mainstream, what is the impact?
Expected returns will be lower, price will go higher.

Taste for ESG is belief or preference? Preference

### Model overview

Firms range from green to brown, full continium
Continium of investors, care to not care about ESG

Solve for equilibrium in the model

Each company have their own "greeness", $g_n$ > 0 to $g_n$< 0
Degree of how investor care about ESG, $d_i$ > 0 to $d_i$ < 0

* One period from 0 to 1
* Firms:
	* Assume that we know firms are green or brown
	* Returns are normally distributed

* Agents
	* CARA utility with two component (financial and nonfinancial)
	* Absolute risk aversion of agent it
	* Wealth of agent i at time 1
	* Portfolio weights of agent it
	* $b_i$ = $d_i$ * $g_n$ = Nonpecuniary benefit agent i derives from holding stock n
		* d_i > 0 is agent i's "ESG taste"

Financial values + moral values

People don't care about aggregate social impact
* Nothing changes
Only the aggregate actions of the agents that make the planet greener

### Solving the Model

Agent i chooses portfolio weight to max expected utility, taking mu as given

Set supply = demand

Solve for equilibrium mu

#### Equity premium

##### Market level expected return

Relative risk aversion x market volatility - (avg degree agents care / rel risk aversion) x market greenness

If the market is green, equity premium is decreasing
Get utility from holding green

If market is brown, equity premium compensate for holding 

Assume the greenness to be zero (market portfolio is ESG-neutral)

Expected excess stock returns

##### Firm level expected return

mu = CAPM - adjustment for greenness (described as alphas)

Greener stocks have lower alphas
* Green stocks have negative alphas
* Brown stocks have positive alphas

##### Agent level expected return

If I care about ESG, lower expected returns
And the inverse

Assume g is deterministic, no risk in g, risk in d shifting
People's taste can stenghten or weaken

What would happen to the model if there is uncertainty about the ESG expected return 

See: Johan abramoff

This model is the simplest model possible

##### Portfolio tilts

Portfolio weights = market weight + ESG tilt

Three-fund separation
* Riskless asset
* Market portfolio
* "ESG portfolio"

The greener the firm, the higher the weight in ESG portfolio

Take covariance into account

Agents who care tilts more toward green assets
Agents who don't tilts more toward brown assets
People who care is avg, hold the market portfolio

If there is no dispersion in ESG tastes, everyone holds the market

##### Two-factor pricing with the ESG portfolio

Alpha comes from omitted priced ESG risk factor
Alpha comes from tastes, not aversion to ESG risk

##### ESG factor

Scaled return by g is the ESG factor

The beta of a given stock on the ESG factor correspond to the greenness of the firm

The premium is negative

How to measure the ESG factor
Long green, short brown

##### Sources of ESG Factor Risk

Strength of ESG concerns can change over time
* "Investor " channel
* "Customer" channel

* Shocks comes from shift in the two channels in the model

Green stocks perform better than expected if ESG concerns strengthen unexpectly via either channel

##### Example

Two types of agents
* ESG investors lamdba
* Non-ESG investors 1 - lambda

Delta: Maximum certain return ESG investor is willing to sacrifice to invest in her desired portfolio rather than in m

Substitubility

There is a return premium that will make people switch from the ESG portfolio to the market

ESG investors always earn less return

Alphas of ESG investors

Everyone holds the market on the two extremes

The more we care about ESG
The lower the alphas of ESG

Investor surplus
The market portfolio is moving toward your portfolio as investors move prices

Non-ESG investor
You want more people to care about ESG
Short green, long brown

Effect of the size of the ESG industry

On the long term, ESG investors become wealthy at a slower rate than non-ESG investors

This is a one period model

If a dynamic model, evolution of taste over time

##### Extension: Climate Risk

Dislike negative shocks in agent i's utility

Climate beta from multiple regression on climate shock and market shocks

Greener stocks likely better hedge climate risk
* Greener stocks have lower alphas for two reasons: tastes and risk

Alpha negatively correlated then

Even if the entire market tilt to greener firms, we can't reduce climate risks.

C is exogenous in their model

##### Extension: Social Impact

S = greenness x size of firm's operating capital

Firm maximizes its market value by choosing how green to be and how much to invest

Quadratic adjustment cost for capital and ESG

Firms chooses to become greener

Green tastes have positive social impact

Two channels
Green firms invest more,
Brown firms invest less
Cost of capital channel

All firms choose to become greener

The more people care, the bigger the shift

If neutral, investment behavior don't change

Assume each agent's utility is increasing in social impact

Agents care about aggregate social impact

Addition of it does nto affect asset prices
Because agents are infinitesimally small

Social impact is caused by the inclusion of portfolio weights, not social impact in the utility function
