# Green vs. Brown
[Is There a Green-to-Brown Premium?](https://www.msci.com/www/blog-posts/is-there-a-green-to-brown/02053435998)


* December 2013 to May 2020, “green” companies performed approximately in line with the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index (IMI), while “brown” companies underperformed the index

* Over a shorter period, from September 2018 to May 2020, green companies outperformed the MSCI ACWI IMI, and brown companies once again underperformed.

* While any “green-to-brown premium” was mainly driven by the underperformance of brown companies over the entire analysis period, a transition to a low-carbon economy may, in the long run, favor green companies and place brown companies at a disadvantage.
