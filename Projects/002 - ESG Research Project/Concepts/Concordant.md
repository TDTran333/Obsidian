In statistics, the concordance correlation coefficient measures the agreement between two variables, e.g., to evaluate reproducibility or for inter-rater reliability. 

A pair of observations is concordant if the subject who is higher on one variable is also higher on the other variable. A pair of observations is discordant if the subject who is higher on one variable is lower on the other variable.

There are two accepted measures of non-parametric rank correlations: Kendall’s tau and Spearman’s (rho) rank correlation coefficient.

In most of the situations, the interpretations of Kendall’s tau and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient are very similar and thus invariably lead to the same inferences.

Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient is the more widely used rank correlation coefficient.
