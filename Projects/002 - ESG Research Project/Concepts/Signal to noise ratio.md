Quants generally divide asset price movements into two components--signal and noise. Signal is the portion we can understand, model and predict. For example, companies that reported good earnings have historically seen their stock prices go up, and the average amount by which companies’ stock prices have risen is considered the signal. The noise component, on the other hand, consists of the unpredictable component of price movements.

Because the signal component is predictable, we can build investment strategies around them. For example, if we build a model that predicts companies’ earnings with a high degree of accuracy, we could build a strategy that invests in companies who are about to make positive earnings reports. However, the extent to which this strategy can work is limited by the strength of the signal relative to noise.

**In other words, the lower the signal to noise ratio, the more data you need in order to validate a signal.**
