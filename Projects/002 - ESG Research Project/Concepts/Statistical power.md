### What is statistical power?

##### According to wikipedia: 
The power of a binary hypothesis test is the probability that the test rejects the null hypothesis ($H_0$) when a specific alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) is true â€” i.e., it indicates the probability of avoiding a type II error. The statistical power ranges from 0 to 1, and as statistical power increases, the probability of making a type II error (wrongly failing to reject the null hypothesis) decreases.
