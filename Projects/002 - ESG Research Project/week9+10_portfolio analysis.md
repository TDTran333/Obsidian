## Analysis for week 9 and week 10
We would like to see the impact of choosing stocks based on ESG indicators combined with the False Rate Discovery methodology.
To that effect, we will build portfolios and backtest them.

## To do
- [ ] Add a table with [min, max, stdev]
- [ ] Maybe add a herfindahl index
- [ ] Number of firms that really outperform. How do I capture that?
- [ ] Top green, top brown
	- [ ] 3 portfolios
		- [ ] Long-short top 10 / bottom 10 equiweighted
		- [ ] Remaining stock as benchmark
