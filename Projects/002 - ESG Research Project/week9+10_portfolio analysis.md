## Analysis for week 9 and week 10
We would like to see the impact of choosing stocks based on ESG indicators combined with the False Rate Discovery methodology.
To that effect, we will build portfolios and backtest them.

What are the portfolios we need:
Within ESG group type
* Top 10 green pipos minus top 10 pineg
* Top 10 brown pipos minus top 10 pineg
* Remaining stocks as benchmark

Across ESG group types
* Green ESG Portfolio according to ESG classification
* Brown ESG Portfolio according to ESG classification
* Neutral Portfolio as benchmark
* G minus Brown

Do it twice for GHG and Envscore

## To do
- [ ] Add a table with summary stats of performance ratios
- [ ] Maybe add a herfindahl index
- [ ] Top green, top brown
	- [ ] 3 portfolios
		- [ ] Long-short top 10 / bottom 10 equiweighted
		- [ ] Remaining stock as benchmark
