### Day 10 of creating an habit of writing a daily note

I unsterstand FDR now.
I get Ardia and Boudt (2018) at 70%.
I understand Barras et. al (2010) at 90%.
Need to read Storey (2002) but I understand the logic.
Oops. Forgot about the critics in 2019 and the reply. Need to cover that.

Spend a few more hours on FDR BUT

Need to cover ESG by 3-4 pm. URGENT.
