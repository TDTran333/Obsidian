	- If Bitcoiners are going to insist on actually comparing the currency to the big fiats, then they should use proper measures. What is the Bitcoin share of international payments? What is the Bitcoin share of central bank reserves? How much Bitcoin-denominated debt is there? These are the logical type of ways to rank and compare money.
	- Armstrong’s key insight was that to mainstream the crypto industry, there had to be an interface that worked with existing banks and governments. For a crypto exchange to go mainstream, its security had to be top-notch.
	- ARK Investment Management bought shares of newly-public Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) for three different funds, while selling some of its Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) holdings. For about $246M worth of Coinbase shares.
- [ ] Financial News
	- Chase and Goldman Sachs score record quarters
		- In the first quarter of the year, IPO companies raised a record $162B (compared to $37B in the first quarter of 2020). And SPACs have already raised more in 2021 than they did in _all of 2020_. Banks are the ones making IPOs and SPAC mergers happen — and they're getting paid big bucks for underwriting and advising.
	- LVMH's market cap makes it Europe’s most valuable company, beating out oil giants and banks. It's even worth more than Nestlé (Earth's largest food company).
		- LVMH created a mass market for luxury by offering a spectrum of brands with broad pricing, for a broad customer base – not just the mega-rich.
		- LVMH’s edge = appealing to the _aspirational_ rich.
	- The Biden administration is poised to impose a raft of new sanctions on Russia in retaliation for alleged misconduct including the SolarWinds hack and efforts to disrupt the U.S. election
	- America spending on health care: In 2019, that spending reached \$3.8T (\$11.6k per person). By 2028, it’s projected to hit $6.2T.
