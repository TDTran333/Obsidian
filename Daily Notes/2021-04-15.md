	- Chase and Goldman Sachs score record quarters
		- In the first quarter of the year, IPO companies raised a record $162B (compared to $37B in the first quarter of 2020). And SPACs have already raised more in 2021 than they did in _all of 2020_. Banks are the ones making IPOs and SPAC mergers happen — and they're getting paid big bucks for underwriting and advising.
	- LVMH's market cap makes it Europe’s most valuable company, beating out oil giants and banks. It's even worth more than Nestlé (Earth's largest food company).
		- LVMH created a mass market for luxury by offering a spectrum of brands with broad pricing, for a broad customer base – not just the mega-rich.
		- LVMH’s edge = appealing to the _aspirational_ rich.
	- The Biden administration is poised to impose a raft of new sanctions on Russia in retaliation for alleged misconduct including the SolarWinds hack and efforts to disrupt the U.S. election
