### Day 1 of creating an habit of writing a daily note

Today, I am learning to use obsidian. I am also trying to track my time spent with toggl.

What I need to accomplish today is to advance or finish my presentation on alternative asset classes. It is more of an introduction topic so I would briefly covert what are the assets and their characteristics as well as how an individual can invest in them.

I also need to advance on my research project as well. I would like to summarize and take notes about 5 papers today.

I have been falling behind trying to be more productive and researching and reading a lot about productivity. Let's hope I can create a work system that allows me to go into the flow more easily and become more efficient and productive with my time.

Things I need to recognize:
	- How I spend my time in a day
	- Where am I focusing?
	- What are my expectations?

I would need to review the process over time and improve on it.

Hopefully I can develop a system that can become my life system, my personal knowledge management system as well as a workflow that get more efficient over time. 

Goals:
	- Include a Zettelkasten system
	- Develop learning notes
	- Generate a blog from those notes
	- Generate a website showcasing my coding projects
