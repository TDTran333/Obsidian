	- Open DeFi will be governed under a DAO through the issuance of a new governance token. Launched in 2020, Open DeFi is an organisation that aims to facilitate collaboration between Western and DeFi projects.
	- Uniswap popularized automated market-making in DeFi. AMMs rely on pools of tokens and prices set by a standardized formula, allowing for swaps to happen between any two tokens, even if there are no counterparties, as the swap happens directly with smart contracts.

This time though, it has protected its code to prevent dozens of copies from springing up, like they did in its past iteration.
	- Coinbase, the operator of the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, slumped 6% to $256.76 on Thursday, dropping for a fourth straight day. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey issued a stark warning to those investing in cryptocurrencies: “Buy them only if you’re prepared to lose all your money.”

	- PayPal has unveiled the strongest Q1 results in its history — with CEO Dan Schulman also praising "great results" from its crypto service.
	- Government digital currencies, or “govcoins”, are a new incarnation of money. They promise to make finance work better but also to shift power from individuals to the state, alter geopolitics and change how capital is allocated. Instead of holding an account with a retail bank, you would hold one directly with a central bank, through an interface resembling apps such as Alipay or Venmo.
	- Dogecoin is a codebase fork of Luckycoin, which itself was a codebase fork of Junkcoin, which was a codebase fork of Litecoin, which in turn is a codebase fork of Bitcoin.
