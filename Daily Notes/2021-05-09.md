	- Canada's variant-driven third COVID-19 wave drove a loss of 207,000 jobs in April, reports The Canadian Press. The unemployment rate jumped to 8.1 per cent from 7.5 per cent in March, according to Statistics Canada. Most of the losses were concentrated in Ontario, which suffered 153,000 of the job cuts. Younger workers and those in retail were most affected as surges in new infections led to tighter restrictions and lockdowns.
