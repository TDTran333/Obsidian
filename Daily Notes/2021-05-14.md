	- Tether says its reserves are  backed by cash to the tune of . . .  2.9%. It looks like just over 20 per cent of its reserves are made up of liquid, quality assets. The reserve analysis also shows that Tether’s assets are made up mainly of various forms of long and short-term corporate debt. We do not know if this debt is secured or unsecured, nor what the assets backing it are (if there are any). The reserves are thus exposed to unknown levels of credit and liquidity risk.
