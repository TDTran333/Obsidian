	- The weakness in the USD should persist over the next few months due to the very dovish position of the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), as well as the twin deficit (current-account and fiscal) according to national bank economists.
	- The CAD should continue on its upswing, thanks to the substantial global economic growth phase supporting commodity prices. As such, the USD/CAD pair should reach the 1.20 mark as soon as the third quarter of the year.
