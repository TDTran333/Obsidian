### Day 8 of creating an habit of writing a daily note

Today's focus:

* Work on research paper. Need to answer point 1 which is what are the critics about the methodology used in Barras et. al (2010).
* Go over peer performance in ESG setting afterward.
* Do not forget to take 3 hours to finish presentation on alternative investments.

Personal thoughts

Stay consistent and disciplined. Work and rework on yourself. Things will be fine.
