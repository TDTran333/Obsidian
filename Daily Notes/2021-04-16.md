	- [[Adding is favoured over subtracting in problem solving]]. People are prone to apply a ‘what can we add here?’ heuristic (a default strategy to simplify and speed up decision-making). This heuristic can be overcome by exerting extra cognitive effort to consider other, less-intuitive solutions. The bias towards additive solutions might be further compounded by the fact that subtractive solutions are also less likely to be appreciated. Also, previous experience could lead people to assume that they are actually expected to add rather than subtract.
