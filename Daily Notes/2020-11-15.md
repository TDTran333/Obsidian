### Day 7 of creating an habit of writing a daily note

Had a very productive week but it seems I am losing control in the weekend. Bad habits are coming back and I have been procrastinating so much. I feel tired. I keep pushing back what I need to do. I need to learn discipline. I have read enough. I need to act. Actions are what I need. Not theory.
