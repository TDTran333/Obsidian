# Guide for cryptocurrency users and tax professionals
## Basic concepts
The CRA generally treats cryptocurrency like a commodity for purposes of the Income Tax Act. Any income from transactions involving cryptocurrency is generally treated as business income or as a capital gain, depending on the circumstances. Similarly, if earnings qualify as business income or as a capital gain then any losses are treated as business losses or capital losses.

When you use cryptocurrency to pay for goods or services, the CRA treats it as a barter transaction for income tax purposes. https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/it490/archived-barter-transactions.html

To figure out the value of a cryptocurrency transaction where a direct value cannot be determined, you must use a reasonable method. Keep records to show how you figured out the value.

If you hold more than one type of cryptocurrency in a digital wallet, each type of cryptocurrency is considered to be a separate digital asset and must be valued separately.

## Reporting business income or capital gains from the disposition of cryptocurrency
### What is a disposition?
This refers to the way you get rid of something, such as by giving, selling or transferring it. In general, possessing or holding a cryptocurrency is not taxable. But there could be tax consequences when you do any of the following:
-   sell or make a gift of cryptocurrency
-   trade or exchange cryptocurrency, including disposing of one cryptocurrency to get another cryptocurrency
-   convert cryptocurrency to government-issued currency, such as Canadian dollars
-   use cryptocurrency to buy goods or services

## Is it business income or capital gain?
The income you get from disposing of cryptocurrency may be considered business income or a capital gain. In order to report it correctly, you must first establish what kind of income it is.

The following are common signs that you may be carrying on a business:
-   you carry on activity for commercial reasons and in a commercially viable way
-   you undertake activities in a businesslike manner, which might include preparing a business plan and acquiring capital assets or inventory
-   you promote a product or service
-   you show that you intend to make a profit, even if you are unlikely to do so in the short term

## Reporting as either income or capital gain
Generally, if disposing of cryptocurrency is part of a business, the profits you make on the disposition or sale are considered business income and not a capital gain.

If the sale of a cryptocurrency does not constitute carrying on a business, and the amount it sells for is more than the original purchase price or its adjusted cost base, then the taxpayer has realized a capital gain.

Capital gains from the sale of cryptocurrency are generally included in income for the year, but only half of the capital gain is subject to tax. This is called the taxable capital gain. Any capital losses resulting from the sale can only be offset against capital gains; you cannot use them to reduce income from other sources, such as employment income. You can carry forward your capital losses if you do not have any capital gains against which to offset those losses for the year or any of the preceding three years.

## Trading cryptocurrency for another type of cryptocurrency
Generally, when you dispose of one type of cryptocurrency to acquire another cryptocurrency, the barter transaction rules apply. You have to convert the value of the cryptocurrency you received into Canadian dollars. This transaction is considered a disposition and you have to report it on your income tax return. Report the resulting gain or loss as either business income (or loss) or a capital gain (or loss).

## Earning cryptocurrencies through mining
Cryptocurrencies are commonly acquired in two ways:
-   bought through a cryptocurrency exchange
-   earned through mining

The income tax treatment for cryptocurrency miners is different depending on whether their mining activities are a personal activity (a hobby) or a business activity.

## Valuing cryptocurrencies either as capital property or inventory
When cryptocurrencies are held as capital property, you must record and track the adjusted cost base so that you can accurately report any capital gains.

If the cryptocurrencies are considered to be inventory, use one of the following two methods of valuing inventory consistently from year to year:
-   value each item in the inventory at its cost when it was acquired or its fair market value at the end of the year, whichever is lower
-   value the entire inventory at its fair market value at the end of the year (generally, the price that you would pay to replace an item or the amount that you would receive if you sold an item)

## Keeping books and records
If you acquire (by mining or otherwise) or dispose of cryptocurrency, you have to keep records of your cryptocurrency transactions. This also applies to businesses that accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and services.

You are responsible for keeping all required records and supporting documents for at least six years from the end of the last tax year they relate to.

You should maintain the following records on your cryptocurrency transactions:
-   the date of the transactions
-   the receipts of purchase or transfer of cryptocurrency
-   the value of the cryptocurrency in Canadian dollars at the time of the transaction
-   the digital wallet records and cryptocurrency addresses
-   a description of the transaction and the other party (even if it is just their cryptocurrency address)
-   the exchange records
-   accounting and legal costs
-   the software costs related to managing your tax affairs.

If you are a miner, also keep the following records:
-   receipts for the purchase of cryptocurrency mining hardware
-   receipts to support your expenses and other records associated with the mining operation (such as power costs, mining pool fees, hardware specifications, maintenance costs, and hardware operation time)
-   the mining pool details and records

## How does the GST/HST apply to cryptocurrency?
Where a taxable property or service is exchanged for cryptocurrency, the GST/HST that applies to the property or service is calculated based on the fair market value of the cryptocurrency at the time of the exchange.

If your business accepts cryptocurrency as payment for taxable property or services, the value of the cryptocurrency for GST/HST purposes is calculated based on its fair market value at the time of the transaction.

Keep all records that show how you calculated the fair market value.
