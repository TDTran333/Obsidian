# Why Centralized Cryptocurrency Mining Is a Growing Problem
Within the world of cryptocurrencies, ASICs are designed to mine specific cryptocurrencies or particular hashing algorithms. Essentially, ASICs are targeted pieces of hardware that aim to beat out general graphics processing units GPUs by being more efficient (and therefore more lucrative) when applied to the cryptocurrency mining process.

ASICs are so powerful that once a coin-specific ASIC is released, it is usually unprofitable to mine without one, according to a report by Oxen, a company that creates privacy tools that enable untraceable, secure transactions and anonymous transactions.

### Key Takeaways
-   In the digital currency mining world, the use of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) remains a complicated issue.
-   ASICs are targeted pieces of hardware that aim to beat out general graphics processing units (GPUs) by being more efficient (and therefore more lucrative) when applied to the cryptocurrency mining process.
-   ASICs are so powerful that once a coin-specific ASIC is released, it is usually unprofitable to mine without one.
-   There are very few manufacturers of ASICs; this means that the space is highly centralized.
-   When a small number of companies have near-total control over distribution rights to hashing power for a cryptocurrency (via the provision of unequaled ASIC technology), the process of mining itself becomes more centralized.

### Concerns About the Prominence of Bitmain
Bitmain is one of the largest and most prominent ASIC manufacturers. Bitmain has repeatedly launched ASIC miners for coins that developers had claimed were "ASIC-resistant," meaning that the mining process could not be made more efficient through a specialized piece of hardware. However, these specialized ASICs have routinely proven developers wrong, showing that they can, in fact, be more profitable.

### The 51% Attack Issue
The impact of this reality on the cryptocurrency ecosystem) is that companies like Bitmain will undoubtedly be able to continue developing hardware that allows for more efficient and more profitable mining.

Beyond outmaneuvering other miners, though, ASIC developers could easily end up controlling more than 50% of the hashing power on a blockchain when they have effectively blocked out non-ASIC miners. Once a group controls a majority of hashing power, that group can then abuse the decentralized nature of many cryptocurrencies, even rewriting transactions on a supposedly-immutable distributed ledger. This process is known as a 51% attack.

### How to Decentralize Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) Manufacturing
* Decentralize the manufacturing process for ASIC miners. 
* Implement a new hashing algorithm that could effectively obliterate all existing ASIC miners.
* Fork currencies in an attempt to limit the usefulness of particular ASICs.
* Work on structures and schemes which are secure even when the hash rate is all pooled into a small number of places.
