# How Are Financial Advisors Using Crypto

Hougan highlighted three main factors that may contribute to the growth of cryptocurrencies, including rising concerns about inflation, significantly less supply, and the rapid normalization of crypto.

We are witnessing a rapid normalization of the asset class, with early majority, late majority, and laggards buying into the market. For example, Nasdaq-listed Microstrategy raised Bitcoin holdings to $425 million after its second purchase. Square bought $50 million, arguing that crypto “aligned with company’s purpose.” PayPal is allowing Bitcoin and crypto spending. BlackRock even said Bitcoin could replace gold to some degree.

### How Are Financial Advisors Using Crypto?
Bitwise / ETF Trends 2020 Benchmark Survey of Financial Advisor Attitudes Toward Cryptoassets, which included 994 qualifying financial advisors across independent RIAs, broker-dealers, financial planners, and wirehouse representatives.
* 76% said they do not own crypto in their personal portfolio
* 19% of respondents said clients did not ask about crypto in the past 12 months
* 26% survey participants revealed clients do not invest in crypto on their own
* 38% indicated they did not know about any of clients’ crypto investments
* 91%, of participants do not allocate crypto to client accounts
* 15% said they will definitely not allocate any crypto to client accounts in the next year
* 28% indicated they will probably not in the next year

Among the most popular reasons for adding crypto to a portfolio, survey participants highlighted low or uncorrelated returns with other assets, high potential returns, something new to offer clients, that clients are asking for it, and inflation hedging

“Low correlations are a key driver of advisor interest, and using crypto as a hedge against inflation is gaining traction, with the latter up from 9% to 25% of advisors surveyed,” Hougan said.

51% of respondents indicated that they would fund an allocation to crypto in client portfolios through an alternatives category, while 18% would allocate through cash, 17% through equities, 10% through commodities, and 5% through fixed-income.

54% of respondents pointed to regulatory concerns as a major impediment to preventing them from investing in crypto. Other factors that are preventing crypto allocations include volatility, lack of easily accessible investment vehicles, uncertain valuation of crypto assets, lack of understanding, custody concerns, cybersecurity, confidence about talking in-depth about crypto to clients, criminal association, reputational risk, and potential for scams.

Looking ahead, financial advisors want improved regulation, better education, launch of a tradable ETF, better custodial solutions, easier trading, and less volatility before they see more widespread recognition of cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class. If all of these factors were supported, 64% of respondents would use a cryptocurrency-related ETF to access the asset class. 16% said they would use direct ownership of the individual coins.
