# Coinbase Notes
## Summary
- digital currencies, store of value, medium of exchange.
- deep dive into COIN's model, storage, trading, price target.

### Fintech Ecosystem
Fintech: "anything utilizing technology to improve an established process."

Payment sector: predictable, sustainable and recurring revenues of their businesses, where they essentially earn revenue per swipe economics.

Similar to these payment and transaction-based models, many of the exchanges also earn revenue, free cash flow and profits per transaction or trade. When it comes to trading certain assets (interest rates, equities, commodities, foreign currency, etc.), there tend to be high barriers to entry or an impregnable moat around certain franchises. While many of these businesses are not recession proof, they have proven to be recession resistant.

Most traditional Financials are not transaction based business models.
Banking model: simply look to borrow capital at a low fee and lend it out to borrowers at a higher rate.

### Digital Currencies
#### Requirements To Be A Currency
**Store of value**
Any asset that can smoothly maintain its economic value, rather than rapidly depreciating.

**Medium of exchange**
An instrument used to facilitate the sale, purchase or trade of goods between parties.

In terms of speed and efficiency, there is no comparison when comparing the centralized payment system to Bitcoin's decentralized platform. 
* Visa processes 1,700 transactions per second and it claims to have 40x the spare capacity, to handle 65,000 transactions per second. 
* PayPal stated that during the 2020 holiday shopping season, it processed over 1,000 transactions per second. 
* Using Bitcoin and its blockchain for global purchases and payments can process roughly 7 transactions per second.

As technology improves, one could argue Bitcoin processing will improve.

##### Acceptance
There are significant acceptance advantages to the existing payment ecosystem. Visa and Mastercard are accepted in over 200 countries and at over 40 million global merchants. Their payment acceptance brands stand for trust and allow billions of purchase transactions to occur each year. The Visa and Mastercard logos are known around the world, permitting the exchange of goods and services in seconds. 

While Bitcoin is slowly becoming more recognizable, it simply does not have the same acceptance. 

We believe the existing payment ecosystem handles the "medium of exchange" process well. The overall payment landscape is a well-oiled machine, that involves three to four parties, approving transactions in roughly 1 to 2 seconds.



Digital currencies are becoming a feasible "store of value". However, digital currencies have significant challenges to becoming a "medium of exchange". The SEC and IRS have not deemed cyrptocurrencies as currencies but instead, consider them capital assets. If they were to be used for payment, the underlying client will potentially have capital gain taxes.

Art and collectibles are a $20 trillion market, gold is $10 trillion, real estate is $200 trillion, bonds are $100 trillion and equities are another $30 trillion.

### Inflation
The ability of countries to simply print money should inherently be inflationary. Many cryptocurrency bulls will cite inflationary worries with fiat currencies for why their digital cryptocurrencies assets are undervalued.

If you are the US or the European Union or Chinese government, would you be able to control your society if there wasn't a viable currency in place? Would economies function without government control of its fiat currency? If cryptocurrencies become widely accepted and are considered a better version of payment, would governments be able to function? If the US couldn't issue additional debt to fund its spending initiatives, would it even exist? We just don't believe government regulators will allow certain cryptocurrencies to thrive, especially if it threatens their sovereign currencies.

Digital assets and cryptocurrencies have a long way to go to become used in our globally interconnected economies.

### Rules & Regulations
Just like banks need to conduct AML (anti-money laundering) and KYC (know your customer) due diligence on its customer base, the exchanges need to follow strict guidelines enforced by their regulators.

The financial systems are not known as entities that are quick to adopt change and technology. The world has embraced the internet, as a revolutionary and transformational platform. However, financial systems are not comfortable seamlessly exchanging data, information and assets. There are numerous activities like cross border payments or peer-to-peer payments that are ideally suited for technological advancements, but rules and regulations exist to stymie growth.

### Volatility
If we accept cryptocurrency as a digital asset, we then want to better understand how value is determined, where it can be stored and how best to process and handle its exchange. With decentralized assets, the network allows participants to transact without intermediaries. Who sets the value and determines price?

Since January of 2017, there have been 5 corrections of 50% or more in Bitcoin, so it can be wildly volatile.

### Stable Coins
A stable coin is simply a digital asset that is attempting to lower volatility by pegging itself to an actual fiat currency or physical asset (ex: gold). For example, Tether has a market capitalization of over $40 billion, is backed by US dollars and it's the largest cryptocurrency stable coin. One of the risks associated with stable coins is ensuring that the proper amount of fiat currency is held in reserve to match the amount of stable coins in circulation.

There are numerous countries that are investigating the process of issuing CBDC's or Central Bank Digital Currencies. China has studied the process of issuing a digital yuan, the European Central Bank is looking into a digital Euro.

### Conclusion
What we do know is that we prefer to own the medium where these "assets" trade. We truly have no idea what the price of Bitcoin will do, except we know that it will be very volatile. As we know, volatility leads to trading, which should equate to profits for the exchanges.

## Coinbase
There are hundreds of platforms that want to democratize access to the crypto-economy, but COIN (as the oldest and most recognizable brand) seems to have an early lead in this race.

It has since launched cryptocurrency payments, distribution capabilities, storage, borrowing and lending services.

In 2020, Bitcoin represented 41% of COIN's trading volumes and 15% came from Ethereum.

### Revenue
COIN's 2020 $1.28 billion of revenue grew 130% year-over-year and was a mix of 86% Transactional, 3% Subscription & Services and 11% "Other". Transactional means revenue was derived from sending, receiving, investing and spending cryptocurrencies. The remaining 14% of total revenue came from paying, distributing, storage, and from borrowing and lending cryptocurrencies.

### Customer Type
Retail was bigger at $45 billion in the 1 st quarter of 2018 than it was at the end of last year at $32 billion. Institutional trading volumes have gone from $11 billion in the 1 st quarter of 2018 and now are over $57 billion.

### Trading volumes
So far in 2021, COIN has experienced 298% growth in ADV (average daily volumes). What did Bitcoin increase last year? Just over 300%. There's clearly a very high correlation between Bitcoin's recent price and COIN's future ADV.

### Pricing
COIN has two main fee structures, one called Coinbase Pro and the other called Coinbase Prime.
Over the last 8 quarters., retail client transactional revenue has increased from 1.27% up to 1.47%. For institutional clients, revenues as a percentage of volumes traded have fallen from 0.07% down to 0.05%.

### Customers
The strengths of COIN's platform seem to be its vast and extensive network of contacts. COIN is leveraging its trusted brand to attract those that want access to transact or store cryptocurrencies.

COIN's growth strategy is based upon driving more customers onto its platform and becoming the de-facto platform for cryptocurrency. Just like the online brokers did in the 1990s, the key to growth was adding new accounts and clients to the platform.

COIN has 2.8 million MTU or monthly transacting users. In order to be considered a customer needs to have logged in and transacted one time, over a 28-day rolling period.

As of today, COIN has roughly 3 million MTUs, which was up +180% year-over-year, but we like to think of it as only 7% of its verified total accounts.

The best avenue to increase accounts and customers is to offer a product that cannot be easily replicated. COIN can continue its account growth by launching new and innovative products, as well as offering access to new cryptocurrencies.

### Storage
While the vast majority of COIN's revenue is trading based, COIN does earn subscription and service revenue when customers choose to safely store their cryptocurrencies on its platform.

COIN have a separate company, called Coinbase Custody, which operates as a standalone, independently-capitalized business. Under New York State Banking Law, Coinbase Custody is considered a fiduciary. All digital assets are segregated and held in a trust.

At the end of 2020, COIN had $90.3 billion in assets on its platform, which was up +432% year-over-year. Of these assets, 70% was from Bitcoin and another 13% were Ethereum.

### Wallets
"Hot wallets" are connected to the internet and are considered much less secure, while "cold wallets" are kept offline. Most cryptocurrency custodians employ "cold" storage to safely hold a client's digital assets.

Acting as a cold cryptocurrency custodian, COIN derives fee revenue based on a percentage of the daily value of customer accounts.

### Custody
In addition to hot versus cold wallets, there are two primary ways to store your Bitcoin. The first is called self-custody. This is when an individual or entity has complete control of their Bitcoin. This entails maintaining and controlling your own private key. If you do not control the private key for your Bitcoin, it is not truly your Bitcoin.

The second way to store your Bitcoin is to outsource it to a trusted custodian, like Kraken, Coinbase, Anchorage or others. In this case, the custodian stores your Bitcoin for you and they have control over its private key. Kraken is security focused and has a time-tested private key management practice. In its 10-years of existence, it has never been hacked.

Whether one decides to self-custody or use an outsourced custody provider for storing your Bitcoin, two critical issues must be discussed. The first is trust. Do you trust the custodial firm that holds your Bitcoin? If one self-custodies, they bear the risk of lost private keys, break-ins or natural disasters. On the other hand, self-custody ensures you control your own Bitcoin. The obvious downside of self-custody is that one can lose all of your Bitcoin, if it is not stored properly.

Do you trust the bank that holds your checking account or brokerage firm that holds your stocks? US financial institutions are some of the most highly regulated companies in the world and most have proven themselves to be good custodians of our assets.

Kraken has been voted the #1 most secure cryptocurrency exchange by ICO Ratings.

The second key issue to consider is protection and safety. Cryptocurrency custodians and exchanges are a prime target for hackers.

Trusting someone else to store and manage your Bitcoin is a challenging decision. There have been a few custody firms to have disastrous results (i.e. Mt. Gox), but there are also extremely competent businesses that can trusted to hold your cryptocurrencies.

### Conclusion
COIN has a strong brand name and dominates its cryptocurrency niche. Its platform is scalable and by leveraging certain blockchain advancements, COIN can provide a safe and secure environment for its customers.

In terms of COIN's cryptocurrency market share, it has risen from 4.5% in 2018 to 8.3% in 2019 up to 11.0% in 2020.

**Risk #1: Bitcoin**
Possibly the biggest risk for owning COIN stock will be its reliance and dependency on rising Bitcoin and Ethereum prices.

**Risk #2: Competition**
On the retail front, COIN has numerous competitors. For example, both Square's Cash App (36 million users) and PayPal (375 million accounts) are offering mobile-based wallets, primarily to retail clients. Customers can purchase various cryptocurrencies on both Square and PayPal and store them for free.

**Risk #3: Regulations**
Exchanges are highly regulated entities and they must learn to engage with their regulators for the benefit of all market participants. COIN is subject to a regulated environment, but the rules and landscape are dynamic. Unlike US financials, with a known regulator, the laws and rules cryptocurrencies are subject to are constantly changing. As COIN moves more of its business to international markets, it will have additional governmental issues to deal with.

Grayscale has over $38 billion in assets and is the sponsor of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which provides Bitcoin exposure for qualified investors. GBT investors have a $25,000 minimum investment and currently pay a 2.5% management fee.

Many firms (Skybridge Capital, Valkyrie Digital, Fidelity Investments, VanEck, WisdomTree, etc) have announced their intention to offer Bitcoin ETF's. attempted to get the SEC to approve Bitcoin ETF's. As of now, the SEC has not approved any of these filings, but it will ultimately have to make a decision on the subject. Earlier SEC rejections were based upon problems with volatility, transparency, market surveillance and market and price manipulation.

**Risk #4: Security**
COIN's valuation is dependent upon it keeping its first-mover advantage and its reputation as a dominant cryptocurrency custodian. Security, for customers and partners, cannot be underestimated and COIN will have a very large target on its back.

### Scale & EBITDA Margins
Last year, CBOE posted 68% EBITDA margins and CME and ICE each posted margins in the 62% to 63% range. Despite trailing their competitors, Nasdaq had impressive EBITDA margins of 55%, which would be the envy of most companies. One key takeaway is that all of the exchanges are generating impressive margins with excellent leverage and scale opportunities. COIN's at 41%.

Last year, technology and development expenses were $271.7 million or 21% of COIN's total revenue. In 2019, this expense line item was 35% of revenue.

The real benefit for the exchanges comes when volatility spikes and volumes soar. As this happens, assuming the exchanges properly manages this rising volatility, profitability climbs. As more and more volumes transact on a platform, free cash flow (and margins) is very attractive.
