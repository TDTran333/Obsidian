## Summary
- digital currencies, store of value, medium of exchange.
- deep dive into COIN's model, storage, trading, price target.

### Fintech Ecosystem
Fintech: "anything utilizing technology to improve an established process."

Payment sector: predictable, sustainable and recurring revenues of their businesses, where they essentially earn revenue per swipe economics.

Similar to these payment and transaction-based models, many of the exchanges also earn revenue, free cash flow and profits per transaction or trade. When it comes to trading certain assets (interest rates, equities, commodities, foreign currency, etc.), there tend to be high barriers to entry or an impregnable moat around certain franchises. While many of these businesses are not recession proof, they have proven to be recession resistant.

Most traditional Financials are not transaction based business models.
Banking model: simply look to borrow capital at a low fee and lend it out to borrowers at a higher rate.

### Digital Currencies
#### Requirements To Be A Currency
**Store of value**
Any asset that can smoothly maintain its economic value, rather than rapidly depreciating.

**Medium of exchange**
An instrument used to facilitate the sale, purchase or trade of goods between parties.

In terms of speed and efficiency, there is no comparison when comparing the centralized payment system to Bitcoin's decentralized platform. 
* Visa processes 1,700 transactions per second and it claims to have 40x the spare capacity, to handle 65,000 transactions per second. 
* PayPal stated that during the 2020 holiday shopping season, it processed over 1,000 transactions per second. 
* Using Bitcoin and its blockchain for global purchases and payments can process roughly 7 transactions per second.

As technology improves, one could argue Bitcoin processing will improve.

##### Acceptance
There are significant acceptance advantages to the existing payment ecosystem. Visa and Mastercard are accepted in over 200 countries and at over 40 million global merchants. Their payment acceptance brands stand for trust and allow billions of purchase transactions to occur each year. The Visa and Mastercard logos are known around the world, permitting the exchange of goods and services in seconds. 

While Bitcoin is slowly becoming more recognizable, it simply does not have the same acceptance. 

We believe the existing payment ecosystem handles the "medium of exchange" process well. The overall payment landscape is a well-oiled machine, that involves three to four parties, approving transactions in roughly 1 to 2 seconds.
