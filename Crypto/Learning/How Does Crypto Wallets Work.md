# How Does Crypto Wallets Work
TLDR:
Bitcoin aren't stored in your wallet, your wallet is nothing but the private keys that allow you to prove that the bitcoin on the network are yours. Protect your private keys.

### Summary
* Your funds are bound to a public key (username) in a global database.
* The public key (username) is determined by a private key (password) automatically.
* You do not need to know your public key to access your funds.
* A private key (password) is 64 characters long and an algorithm is used to determine its public key (username).
* Nobody should know your private key (password) but anyone can know your public key (username).
* Which means storing a private key (password) on a USB is just a text file with a private key (password) in it.
* To secure your private key (password) further there are devices called Hardware Wallets that require you to physically press buttons to decrypt your private key (password) to access to your funds.
* These devices plugin to your computer but don't just give you or any malware a plain text password.
