# Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto?
Satoshi Nakamoto is the anonymous name used by the creators of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.

Although the name Satoshi Nakamoto is often synonymous with Bitcoin, the actual person that the name represents has never been found, leading many people to believe that it is a pseudonym for a person with a different identity or a group of people.

### Key Takeaways
-   Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym who penned the original Bitcoin whitepaper and is the identity credited with inventing Bitcoin itself.
-   While several people have claimed to be Satoshi, the true identity has never been verified nor revealed.
-   Given the price of BTC today, Satoshi would be a billionaire.

The convention is that Bitcoin with a capital "B" should be used when referring to the Bitcoin system, network, protocol, etc.; bitcoin with a small "b" should be used when referencing bitcoin tokens or units in exchange.
