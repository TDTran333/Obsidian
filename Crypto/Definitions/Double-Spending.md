# What Is Double-Spending?

Double-spending is the risk that a digital currency can be spent twice. It is a potential problem unique to digital currencies because digital information can be reproduced relatively easily by savvy individuals who understand the blockchain network and the computing power necessary to manipulate it.

With digital currency, there is a risk that the holder could make a copy of the digital token and send it to a merchant or another party while retaining the original.

### Key Takeaways
-   Double-spending occurs when a blockchain network is disrupted and cryptocurrency is essentially stolen. The thief would send a copy of the currency transaction to make it look legitimate, or might erase the transaction altogether.
-   Although it is not common, double-spending does occur. What is much more likely, however, is cryptocurrency being stolen from a wallet that wasn't properly secured.
-   The most common method of double-spending is when a blockchain thief will send multiple packets to the network, reversing the transactions so that it looks like they never happened.
