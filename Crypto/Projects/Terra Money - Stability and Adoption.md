# White paper: Terra Money : Stability and Adoption

### Abstract
A successful new digital currency needs to maximize adoption in order to become useful.

We propose a cryptocurrency, Terra, which is both price-stable and growth-driven.
It achieves price-stability via an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. 
It also uses seigniorage created by its minting operations as transaction stimulus, thereby facilitating adoption.
