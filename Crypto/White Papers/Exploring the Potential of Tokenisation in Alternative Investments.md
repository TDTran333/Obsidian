[[Tokenisation in Alternative Investments]]

# Exploring the Potential of Tokenisation in Alternative Investments
Retail investors increasingly understand the risk profile associated with alternative investments and are interested in actively allocating to them. They are also more willing to lock up their capital for the longer term. However, the reality is that, generally, only accredited investors are allowed access to these investments, leaving retail investors with no entry point. Essentially, access to alternative investments depends on the individual’s net worth, and with the current level of net worth required, retail investors generally miss out.

### TOKENISATION
**Tokenisation is the digitalisation of an asset using blockchain technology.** The underlying asset could be a traditional asset class (like a stock or a bond) or an alternative asset class investment (like private equity or real estate).

To better understand the topic of tokenisation, CAIA partnered with Liquefy, a leading tokenisation solutions expert, and BNP Paribas Asset Management, one of the world’s largest asset managers, in **[a white paper on Tokenisation of Alternative Investments](https://caia.org/sites/default/files/2021-02/CAIA_Tokenisation_of_Alternatives.pdf)**. Our aim was to explore the application of tokenisation across the broad spectrum of alternative investments. We also identified the benefits and the challenges of applying tokenisation in each of the alternative asset classes.

### WIDENING ACCESS
A key benefit of tokenisation is **fractionalization**. This allows for the ownership of an underlying asset to be split across many investors. Each investor then benefits according to the proportion that they own. Fractionalisation allows for previously high-ticket investments to be portioned into much more **accessible** ticket sizes. 

In addition, there are other potential benefits such as more efficient processes and lowering of administrative cost which bode favourably to all investors.

While tokenisation may create a secondary market for alternative investments, it does not automatically result in liquidity being available.

### POTENTIAL OF TOKENISATION
A good example to help us imagine the potential for tokenisation is the history and evolution of real estate investment trusts (REITs). A key benefit of a REIT is its ability to provide for wider investor access to commercial real estate. Another key benefit of a REIT is the ability to diversify via fractional ownership. With a REIT, investors can have **fractional ownership to a portfolio of commercial real estate**. 

Tokenisation brings this concept of fractional ownership one step further. Tokens can be created **either on a portfolio of real estate or individual real estate**. In a tokenized world, investors could trade away tokens when they want to reduce exposure to certain type of property, or they could buy more tokens when they want to increase exposure. This contrasts with REITs, which sometimes still have lumpy exposure to a certain geography or sector because they are often a bundle of commercial real estate.

### CONCLUSION
Tokenisation is not without its challenges. There are many questions to be addressed, and these are different for each participant. 

For the end **investors**, they will no doubt ask whether only lower-grade alternative investments will be packaged into tokens—leaving the higher-grade products for the larger ticket writer? Will there be sufficient liquidity in this token should I need to sell? A possible way could be to limit tokenisation to funds where managers have a demonstrated positive track record.

For **fund managers**, the opportunities to widen their reach to a more diverse investor base are appetizing. Tokenisation certainly shows promise as an efficient way to manage large numbers of investors, which previously would have been costly and effort-intensive.

For the **regulators**, tokenisation development will create new challenges, particularly in relation to how they can effectively regulate without hindering market developments. Furthermore, they will need to think about how they protect the most vulnerable of investors.
