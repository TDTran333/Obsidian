# Tokenisation in Alternative Investments
BNP Paribas Asset Management (‘BNPP AM’), together with Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Association (‘CAIAA’) and Liquefy, a Hong-Kong based tokenisation platform, released a new research paper that provides key insights into the benefits and challenges inherent in bringing a tokenisation approach to a wide range of alternative asset classes.

Tokenisation is the process of creating a digital representation of a non-digital asset. **According to the paper, this new technology has great potential to democratise access to alternative investments, while also enabling asset managers to innovate** by investing in alternative asset tokens, thereby broadening the types of exposures they can potentially offer investors.

The tokenisation process is not a ‘one-click’ affair. It involves multiple steps: deal structuring, digitisation, primary distribution, post-token management, and certainly clear regulatory standards to enable secondary market trading.

This paper is the first in the market to cover the broad spectrum of tokenisation across all of the categories broadly defined as being ‘alternative’. It includes a discussion of the basics of blockchain technology and tokenisation, highlights some of the special considerations inherent in bringing tokenisation to alternative investments and, finally, provides key insights and considerations for the major alternative investment categories.

-   Joint paper highlights that tokenisation shows high potential for use with assets that are illiquid and have higher barriers to entry
-   Tokenisation is well positioned as a powerful tool for the wealth and asset management industries, allowing for significant innovation
-   For investors, tokenisation could provide democratised access to investment options, but greater awareness and training will be paramount

### Advantages of Tokenization
Tokenisation approaches have vast potential for addressing the challenges related to investment in illiquid asset classes, with advantages including:

**Improving liquidity**
-   The tokens could be traded on secondary markets, improving liquidity.

**Enabling faster, cheaper transactions**
-   Less complexity and better operational efficiency can reduce transaction and lifetime costs, enabling faster, cheaper transactions.

**Offering greater transparency**
-   The token holder’s rights, legal responsibilities and record of ownership could be embedded into tokens, offering greater transparency.

**Broadening access**
-   Tokens would provide more investors with access to a previously unaffordable or insufficiently divisible asset classes.

Tokenisation could increase access to Alternative Investments for a wider group of investors. It also presents an opportunity to unlock retail assets as an important source of capital to meet financing gaps of meaningful projects (such as infrastructure) in private markets.

### Identifying the challenges
Clearly, technology will not overcome all the challenges that alternative investments may present. Creating a secondary market does not automatically result in liquidity, but we believe it is the ﬁrst step. Constraints remain, for example in the area of hedge funds, private equity and natural resources where a sizeable universe of assets is needed to be able to create a portfolio of tokens for diversiﬁcation.

For **venture capital and private equity**, tokenisation would not necessarily streamline the due diligence process as it could in the private debt and infrastructure markets.

For **real estate** investment, many constraints have been identiﬁed as it is currently one of the most tokenised assets among alternative asset classes. The main constraint is that real estate developers are looking into tokenisation asset by asset, so there is an issue of scalability.

For **private debt**, covenants could be difficult to code into smart contracts, potentially creating a challenge in the life management of the tokens. Infrastructure assets are heavily regulated, which could make it more difficult to construct a smart contract.

In addition, the beneﬁt of greater liquidity does not outweigh the fact that alternative investments are not a silver bullet for achieving target returns. Hedge funds often rely on ﬁnancial market **inefficiencies** to generate alpha. These inefficiencies are sometimes ﬂeeting and often captured in part via an illiquidity premium.

Venture capital is a high-risk and high-return strategy. Investors are bound to lose money on individual deals, but they rely on the outstanding deals to generate returns such that the overall portfolio still meets the performance objective.

Private equity has huge return dispersion. The returns from the best managers and the worst managers are materially different. Real estate and private debt are characterised by information asymmetry and lack of transparency. Infrastructure and natural resources require specialised skills and scale. End-investors need to be capable of understanding and quantifying the risk they are adding to their portfolio.
