# Internet of Things

The Internet of things describes the network of physical objects—“things” or objects—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet.

There are a number of serious concerns about dangers in the growth of IoT, especially in the areas of [privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_privacy "Digital privacy") and [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_security "Digital security"), and consequently industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun including the development of international standards.
