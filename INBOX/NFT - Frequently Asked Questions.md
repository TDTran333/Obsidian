# NFT - Frequently Asked Questions

### What is an NFT? Is it a cryptocurrency?
Non-Fungible Tokens are unique, easily verifiable digital assets that can represent items such as GIFs, images, videos, music albums, and more. Anything that exists online can be purchased as an NFT, theoretically.

-   **What they are:** NFTs are digital assets and a type of cryptographic token. 
-   **What they’re not:** Interchangeable, like cryptocurrencies. Each NFT represents a unique digital asset that can be bought and sold in an open marketplace.

### Why would I want to own an NFT? Can I make money on it?
One reason to buy an NFT is for its emotional value.
The other reason is because you think it’s valuable...and will only increase in value. 

### How do you buy an NFT?
The process varies based on what platform you use. And there are a lot of platforms.

### How do you know your NFT is authentic?
NFT ownership is recorded on the blockchain, and that entry acts as a digital pink slip.

### Are NFTs new?
They’re newly popular, but not new. Andrew Steinwold traces their origins all the way back to blockchain-backed Colored Coins in 2012, but they didn’t move into the mainstream until CryptoKitties had everyone buying virtual cats in 2017.
