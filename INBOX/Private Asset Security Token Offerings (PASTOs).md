# Private Asset Security Token Offerings (PASTOs)
### What is a PASTO
Frictionless representations of investor interests in private asset portfolios in token form. Such a phenomenon is possible thanks to the help of oracles, which are programming languages that allow for information to be easily transformed from current traditional financial technology infrastructure to cryptographically enabled distributed ledger environments. 

The use of these tokens for private equity and venture investments (either funds or as part of the cap table) can be expediated by first recognising the value of the underlying portfolio as separate from the transactional events of the secondary sale of the LP interest.

### Defintion of stablecoin
In the primary state, meaning when the LP has no interest in selling her interest in the fund, the PASTO is synonymous to a stable coin. PASTOs, by design, are for private assets secondary markets as stable coins are for payment activities.

According to the Office of the Comptroller of Currency
* "a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to have a stable value … with some stablecoins…backed by a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar. Fiat-backed stablecoins can typically be exchanged for the underlying fiat currency, where one unit of the stablecoin can be exchanged for one unit of the underlying fiat currency.”
* The definition of stablecoins also includes tokenised offerings backed by other assets. As regards to its use, which is for payment activities, the OCC further noted that “_the stablecoin represents a mechanism for storing, transferring, transmitting, and exchanging the underlying fiat currency value, all of which are key to facilitate payment activities.”

### Why is this relevant for PASTOs?
When we were thinking about how democratisation of privately held assets could flourish, we noted that the existence of an accessible, efficient secondary market would be critical. Going further beyond that, the operation of a secondary market, as we know it today, could be optimised if the concept of PASTOs is well understood and adopted.

#### Transparency
For private equity and venture capital managers the opportunity to tokenise portfolios introduces both portfolio transparency for investors and efficiency in the operation of secondary markets. One of the longstanding perceptions surrounding private assets lies in the fact that such portfolios have traditionally been opaque.

#### Efficiency
PASTOs allow investors to change their allocations up and down at their behest. If this can happen without hindrance, capital can circulate without stress and effectively the pie expands for all involved.

#### Accessibility
Preqin has estimated an emerging sizable market of more than $6 trillion from the wealth market alone. By the last account, ultra-high net worth (UHNW) and family office (FO) investors hold about $16 trillion of illiquid assets globally, and this is set to grow to $24 trillion in the next five years. In our view, the expected growth would, however, be stunted if there is no effective avenue for investors to sell and buy and explore future opportunities on an effective secondary market.

Private equity and venture secondary markets, currently available to institutional sized capital and inaccessible to mainstream investors is at circa $40billion. The innovation provided by PASTOs would be instrumental in developing the secondary markets for private assets and move it further along.

#### Innovation
For enterprises such as private banks, family offices, wealth managers, and other capital managers including crowdfunding platforms that serve a variety of non-institutional clients, the implementation of PASTOs is a channel for innovation and further product extensions.

In the same way that clients hold physical cash and use electronic cards (or other electronic forms) as the mechanism to transfer value between physical and digital states, PASTOs become the mechanism through which value could be exchanged from the physical LPA to a digital asset. The transparency awarded to the end client further increases informed adoption of private assets and consequently contributes to more efficient secondary markets.

### Is there a market?
According to Preqin, formally organised private asset funds and alternative assets could increase by another $7 trillion over the five years from 2020 to $17 trillion. Private equity and venture funds (excluding direct deals and other arrangements) could grow by another $5 trillion over the same period.

In effect, there is a lot of evidence to support a growth in illiquid assets over the next five years and more evidence and support for digital assets in investor portfolios. And rightfully so. The market for digital assets including other crypto variants have also come of age having grown to an institutional level of $350 billion (as at Sept 2020) with more than 6000 different crypto assets in existence.

### Is the supporting technology developed enough to sustain the issuance of PASTOs? Are the base technologies—distributed ledgers and blockchain—stable enough to contain the prospective market of PASTOs?

To study

### Conclusion
Following the OCC’s interpretative letter for PASTOs, the crypto markets have grown and continue to mature in core technology developments and dApps—to the degree that the acceptance of crypto assets by institutional investors now cannot be ignored. The clarity provided by the OCC helps the adoption of PASTOs by private equity and venture capital managers, as well as enterprises in product development projects for clients. The adoption of PASTOs will be increasingly instrumental as both the next frontier and as a backbone to the development of private asset strategies.
