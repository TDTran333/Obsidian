# Expected Geometric Returns
The expected long-term compounded geometric annual rate of return is calculated by taking the expected arithmetic annual return and adjusting it for variance drain or volatility drag, resulting in a reduction of about 50 percent of the variance. Risk is measured using the standard deviation.

Just as the geometric mean is less than the arithmetic mean when the returns are not identical, the compounded return is lower than the expected annual return because of volatility.

The reasons for the volatility drag are explained in an article by James D. MacBeth. [[What's the Long Term Expected Return to Your Portfolio]]

Exact formulas for the compounded return after adjusting for the variance drain were developed by de La Grandville. [[The Long-Term Expected Rate of Return - Setting It Right]]

To improve on the estimate for the variance drain, a factor of 0.46 could be used instead of 50 percent.

Annual Compounded Rate of Return = 	Expected Annual Return – [0.46 x Variance]
