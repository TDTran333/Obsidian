# Seigniorage
Seigniorage is the difference between the face value of money, such as a $10 bill or a quarter coin, and the cost to produce it. In other words, the economic cost of producing a currency within a given economy or country is lower than the actual exchange value, which generally accrues to governments who mint the money.

If the seigniorage is positive, the government will make an economic profit; while a negative seigniorage will result in an economic loss.
	
### Key Takeaways
-   Seigniorage is the difference in face value of money, such as a $0.25 quarter coin, and the cost to produce it.
-   Seigniorage may be counted as positive revenue for a government when the money it creates is worth more than it costs to produce.
-   In some situations, the production of currency can result in a loss instead of a gain for the government creating the currency (e.g. producing copper pennies).
