# Data science UnicoRns
A data science unicorn is someone who has experience performing an unrealistically large array of technical and business-related job duties. The R language, particularly when used with RStudio products, has evolved to enable production-level activities in the areas of data wrangling, reporting/dashboarding, database/software engineering, machine learning, and web application development. It is increasingly plausible that a data scientist will be able to efficiently perform a wide variety of job functions with experience only in a single language (R). Current standards for data scientist job descriptions and salaries do not accommodate this nuance.

### Summary of current benchmarks for data science job descriptions and corresponding salary ranges.

#### Summary of skills
Machine learning
Deploy models for production
Building applications
Integrate data and decision-making

#### Technical requirements
[[Example - DS posting.png]]
Exploratory Data Analysis
Statistical Analysis
Visualisation
Data wrangle
Pipelines with massive amount of data
Interfacing with databases
Deep machine learning

### The job description to offer pipeline
Hiring manager writes a job description
* States the primary purpose, expected deliverables (Why does this job exist).
* Requirements for technical skills, prior experience, and/or education.

HR classifies the role
* Hourly or salary
* Type of contributor: technician, professional, scientist
* Level of contributor: entry, intermediate, senior, principal

Role-specific salary benchmarking data are from purchased compensation surveys
* HR will aggregate across several such sources to derive a salary range
* The ultimate offer varies somewhat by company's compensation philosophy

#### Data Scientist Profile I - V
* Purpose: Summarize and analyze complex/large data to guide business insights
* Independently merge and tidy data from multiple source systems, then conduct appropriate summarization or statistical analyses according to business stakeholder needs
* Use data and visualizations to inform business solutions for organizational leaders
* Organize databases, analyses, and reports into user-accessable and reproducible repositories
* Preferred R stack experience: tidyverse including dbplyr, R makrdown, Shiny, caret, etc.

Notes for profile I (entry/junior level):
* Salary around 55k-65k USD in the US according to aggregate surveys
* May require an advanced degree
* 0-2 years of related experience preferred
* This support role reports to a manager and work is closely managed
* Projects most often contain limited complexity

Notes for profile II (mid-level):
* Salary around 70k-90k USD in the US according to aggregate surveys
* May require an advanced degree
* 2-4 years of related experience preferred
* Typically reports to a manager, through only requires occasional direction
* Gains exposure to some complex tasks of the job

Notes for profile III (senior level):
* Salary around 90k-125k USD in the US according to aggregate surveys
* Typically requires either advanced degree or 4-7 years of related experience, or an approriate mix of the two
* This independent/collaborative member typically reports to a manager, but requires minimal direction
* Contributes to solving complex challenges associated with the role

Notes for profile IV (senior/principal):
* Salary around 115k-150k USD in the US according to aggregate surveys
* Typically requires either advanced degree or 7+ years of related experience, or an approriate mix of the two
* This independent/collaborative member typically reports to a manager or head of a unit, but work is primarily independent
* Often a team lead for complex problems

Notes for profile V (principal/director data scientist):
* Salary around 135k-185k USD in the US according to aggregate surveys
* Typically requires either advanced degree or 10+ years of related experience, or an approriate mix of the two
* This independent/collaborative member typically reports to a manager or head of a unit, but work is autonomous
* Leads teams to solving the most technical and complex problems encountered by the Data Science unit

Primary drivers of salary estimates are expertise and autonomy
* Corollary: You probably don't need to learn fancy new language X to get the job you want
* These drivers may evolve in the data science domain

Salary surveys are not yet capturing specific data science roles
* E.g. machine learning engineer, decision scientist, etc.
