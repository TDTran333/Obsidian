# Introduction to SQL
**Structured Query Language** (SQL â€” typically pronounced either as S-Q-L or as "sequel").

Clauses make up SQL programs, (we commonly call these programs **queries**).

It's actually not necessary to include the semicolon for the query to run. However, it improves the query's readability.

Use the AS statement directly after each query to rename results.

# Introduction to Databases
A database structures data just like a spreadsheet, by organizing data in different tables comprised of rows and columns. A database can store much more data more securely than a spreadsheet or a text file. However, unlike simply opening a spreadsheet, we actually have to "ask" for data from the database. This is what we do when we write queries.

The `SELECT` clause contains the column names.
The `FROM` clause indicate from which table we want to extract the selected columns.
