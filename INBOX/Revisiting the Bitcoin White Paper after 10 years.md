# Bitcoin’s 10th Birthday: Was the Nakamoto White Paper Right?

Originally written under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, the title of Bitcoin’s white paper is deceptively simple: _Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System._ Yet_,_ the content of this 9-page document incited what can only be described as a revolution in the world of [fintech](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fintech.asp). More relevantly, Bitcoin’s white paper laid out an inspiring new definition of money at a time when faith in the traditional financial system was still being salvaged.

Satoshi launched the first Bitcoin client in early 2009 and then handed the project off to the community in 2010.

### Key Takeaways
-   Bitcoin, the original and most popular decentralized digital currency, turned 10 years old in 2019.
-   That marked a decade since the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto released his famous Bitcoin whitepaper, published months earlier in 2008, describing the cryptocurrency's technical specifications and motivations.
-   Here, we revisit the Bitcoin whitepaper, summarizing each of its sections, and showing how it is still relevant today.

Though it is now commonly understood as a ledger, Bitcoin’s white paper portrays the shared transaction log as a sort of timestamp server.

The idea of mining is one of the most controversial aspects of bitcoin due to its rapid consumption of electricity.

Users on the blockchain must use a public key to identify themselves to the network and an associated private key to sign the coins sent to them. This allows them to keep their identity safe while still verifying it on any transaction.

## What Has Changed Since 2008/9?
For an idea that started as an anonymous research paper, it is astounding how many people know about Bitcoin and how large its market capitalization is. To enjoy these accomplishments Bitcoin had to endure several diversions from its original white paper.

**Mining centralization:** Bitcoin’s popularity drove its price up and made mining very lucrative. Though the network is decentralized, those with enough money built large mining facilities in areas that subsidize electricity, thereby concentrating an important source of Bitcoin’s power into the hands of a few.

**Incentives:** Part 6 of the white paper outlines the rewards to miners, but even the largest of them are not immune to market forces. Mining Bitcoin gets progressively harder as the network grows, and so eventually mining it en masse requires a lot of hardware, electricity, and cooling. This creates a breakeven point for mining, which is a factor that was not anticipated in the white paper.

**Blockchain’s size:** Part 7 of the white paper is about keeping blockchain’s size at a minimum, and so far, it’s done a decent job. However, at 317 GB at last measure, it is a significant burden for most retail machines to store.

**Privacy:** Satoshi illustrates his vision for private transactions in part 10, but Bitcoin is now only private for those who take great caution to ensure their anonymity. Most Bitcoin is now traded between centralized exchanges that require ID and occasionally bank account verification, so it is not difficult to trace whom it belongs to or where it is going. Bitcoin’s speculation-fueled popularity put it in the spotlight of government and central banks long ago, and though people understand institutional finance cannot ever destroy Bitcoin entirely, at this point it is as much a part of Bitcoin as regular users are.

**Speed and Fees:** Over time, Bitcoin’s core development team has made changes to its code to address problems with transaction speed and cost. They have altered the size of blocks being verified and opened up pathways for integration with off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network. This is an effective solution in the eyes of some, but Bitcoin has enough advocates to have people on both sides of the fence.

## Distributed Payment Tech & Decentralized Finance
The many varying opinions on how best to operate Bitcoin mean that its family tree is enormous, but the primary coin is still the king. In terms of developer support on Bitcoin and the ecosystem that has grown around it, its market capitalization, and the recognition it has earned on a global scale, there is no arguing that Bitcoin is a force that has momentum. It also fights fiercely in pursuit of its original vision, more so than most open source projects.

The most important value of Bitcoin is the decentralized and trustless nature of transaction settlement. After all, enabling this through the introduction of PoW mining was the most influential and disruptive part of Satoshi's invention.

The idea of distributed payment tech is now a popular idea and will doubtlessly survive in some form moving into the next decade.
