#### How it works

We connect to 11,000 financial institutions across the United States, Canada, and Europe. With Plaid, connecting your bank account is easy:

-   **Step 1**  
    When you sign up with a Plaid-powered app, you’ll be able to select your financial institution from a list. Then, enter your login and password.
-   **Step 2**  
    In a matter of seconds, we encrypt the data you’ve chosen to share (for instance, your account balance) and securely share it with the app you want to use. We never share your login and password with the app.
-   **Step 3**  
    We work behind the scenes to build a secure, ongoing connection between the app and your bank.
