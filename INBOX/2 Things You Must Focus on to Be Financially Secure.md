# 2 Things You Must Focus on to Be Financially Secure
Do you feel financially secure? What would it take for you to build a huge nest egg to become financially secure?

Conventional wisdom says it’s mostly about investing better. It suggests you should focus on getting a higher return or lower fees. Many studies have shown that people working with advisors tend to have much larger investment portfolios.

### Key #1: Better saving behaviour
The CIRANO study showed the real secret is better saving behaviour. People working with advisors had much larger portfolios mainly because they invested more! Those with advisors:

1.  Were more likely to save.
2.  When they saved, it was twice as much (8.6% of income vs. 4.3%).
3.  They invested the savings, leaving much less in cash.
4.  They used RRSPs, TFSAs and other tax methods more effectively.

Financial planning – not investing – is the key to financial security. Saving behaviour is much easier to control than investment returns.

### Key #2: Retirement Plan
Why is having a financial plan, especially a retirement plan, so hugely beneficial? When you have a plan:

1.  You have a clear picture of the future you want.
2.  You know how much to save to get there.
3.  It is important to you, so you find the money to save.
4.  You work towards it consistently.
5.  You are clear on which strategies may fit your plan.
6.  You save tax because it’s obvious whether RRSP, TFSA or other methods are best for you.
7.  You know the return you need, so you may invest less in interest-bearing investments.
8.  You are less likely to get distracted by short-term factors like business news or market crashes.
9.  You think long term.

A retirement plan makes you think long term and puts all your financial decisions in perspective. Whether or not you work with a financial planner, the secret is to have a quality, written financial plan with a retirement plan.

In short, the 2 things you must focus on to achieve financial security are:

**1.  Better savings behaviour. Focus on the 4 saving behaviours.**
**2.  Retirement plan. Develop and follow a retirement plan.**

Investing is the last 20% of financial planning. To have the future you want, focus on the 80%.
