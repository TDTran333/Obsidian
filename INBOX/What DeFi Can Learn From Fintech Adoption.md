# What DeFi Can Learn From Fintech Adoption
DeFi networks, over the last two years, furthered the concepts of being able to save and get credit, even provide and buy insurance.

The World Bank’s definition of financial inclusion states that access should also be “useful and affordable” and delivered in a “responsible and sustainable way”. Given what we know are the issues surrounding the sector, this definition points to at least two painfully obvious hurdles in the DeFi.

* The first is that using DeFi now is simply not affordable for the regular investor thanks to skyrocketing gas fees that make transactions worth less than several hundred dollars inefficient. 

* The second is that there are so few mechanisms that ensure responsibility and sustainability in the way DeFi is delivered, as is proven by the numerous scams and hacks that occur on a daily basis in the space.

#### 1. Don’t make DeFi about tech
#### 2. User-friendliness is king
#### 3. Integrate regular money (fiat on/off ramps)
