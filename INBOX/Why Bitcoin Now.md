# Why Bitcoin Now?
There are two trends that make  bitcoin an increasingly compelling offensive and defensive  
play.

* Bitcoin provides investors upside exposure to digitization: the world is digitizing at a breathtaking pace,  and bitcoin is well-positioned to grow alongside that trend. 
* Bitcoin also provides potential downside protection  as a compelling macro hedge. Its uncorrelated nature makes it an attractive portfolio diversifier in uncertain times: correlation to equities remains stable during most time periods between -0.2 and 0.2.

### Regulatory fundation
* In mid-2015, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) started to grant
cryptocurrency licenses and charters. 
* Two years later, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved platforms like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the CBOE Futures Exchange (CFE) to trade bitcoin futures. 
* In mid-2018, the staff at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) clarified bitcoin’s status as a non-security, an important assessment as debate around cryptocurrency regulation was often focused on coins’ status as securities. 
* More recently, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) clarified their stance on custody: financial institutions may custody digital assets on behalf of their clients.

### Bitcoin adoption
We expect to see bitcoin adoption levels increase across two major investor categories, both of which have largely avoided crypto to date: traditional hedge funds and wealth  
channels.

59% of advisors now indicate that they are likely to allocate client portfolios to bitcoin within the next 12 months.
