# Fungibility
Fungibility is the ability of a good or asset to be interchanged with other individual goods or assets of the same type. [Fungible assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fungibles.asp) simplify the exchange and trade processes, as fungibility implies equal value between the assets.

### Key Takeaways
-   Fungibility is the ability of a good or asset to be readily interchanged for another of like kind.
-   Like goods and assets that are not interchangeable, such as owned cars and houses, are non-fungible.
-   Money is a prime example of something fungible, where a $1 bill is easily convertible into four quarters or ten dimes, etc.
