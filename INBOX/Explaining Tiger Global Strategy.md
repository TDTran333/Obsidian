# Explaining Tiger Global Strategy
1. **Tiger is playing a different game** — Tiger identified several rules / norms / commonly held ideas in venture/growth that are stale & outdated and built a strategy to exploit the contemporary realities around those ideas at scale.
    -   **Norm**: Funds should deploy capital along a pre-defined schedule and then work to maximize MoM. **Reality**: When executed well, GPs and LPs can both make more money from a higher-velocity strategy that ignores traditional deployment schedules, even if it comes at the cost of maximum MoM returns.
        
    -   **Norm**: VCs generally add value to companies post-investment and VC value-add is a core part of any fund’s pitch to a Founder. **Reality**: VCs can cause as much harm as they can help, and they very rarely move the needle for a business after the earliest stages. Therefore, a hands-off investor approach is often more compelling to a Founder than the typical VC offering, especially when paired with a high valuation / low cost of capital.
        
    -   **Norm**: Without an in-depth diligence process, investing in startups even at the growth stage is too risky and will end poorly for those that try. **Reality**: Diligence in categories like SaaS has never been more commoditized, and with the right amount of investment velocity you can de-risk the negative impacts of individual frauds/blow-ups on your portfolio via diversification.

2.  **Tiger will continue scaling because this is a great strategy** — The Velocity<>Better/Faster/Cheaper Capital flywheel that Tiger has created is real, and will continue to enable Tiger to offer a compelling, low-cost of capital product to Founders. Barring a dot-com bubble-like crash, Tiger will continue to generate strong cash returns and take share of the overall private venture/growth asset class over time, due to this flywheel.
    
3. **The victims of Tiger’s continued ascent will be J.C. Penney-esque funds stuck in the “middle” during the impending venture/growth middle squeeze** — Many firms offer neither the signaling/brand association of the world’s best venture funds, or the speed & low cost of capital of Tiger. Most of these firms have relied on a relatively less competitive venture/growth market over the past decade to generate compelling returns, and are not built in a way where they can adjust to these new competitive dynamics. Unless they make drastic changes to their strategy, internal processes, and org structure, they are destined to decline over time and eventually fail entirely.
