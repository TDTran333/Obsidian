# DeFi Wallets
Wallets, allow for sending, receiving and storing cryptocurrency. They come in many different shapes and forms, but the most popular options are:
-   a browser extension
-   a hardware wallet
-   a mobile app
-   a web wallet

DeFi-friendly wallets facilitate managing your digital assets and interacting with DeFi applications, such as decentralized exchanges or lending and borrowing protocols.

### Metamask
Metamask is a crypto wallet and a gateway to blockchain apps. It allows users to easily connect to all popular DeFi apps such as Uniswap, Compound, Aave, Maker and Yearn Finance.

Metamask supports ETH and Ethereum based tokens such as ERC20 and ERC721. It is basically a bridge into Ethereum.

Metamask is non-custodial. This means that users have complete control and ownership over the assets stored in their wallet. Users of non-custodial wallets cannot rely on the wallet provider to recover their wallet and instead, they have to take wallet recovery into their own hands. This is usually achieved by securing a recovery phrase.

A recovery phrase, also known as a seed phrase, is a set of words that can be used to fully restore a wallet with all of its corresponding private and public keys. This means that losing access to your wallet, together with losing your recovery phrase is equal to losing all of your digital assets stored in that wallet. This is also why everyone, who decides to use a non-custodial wallet, has to take the security of their recovery phrase seriously.

The basic security measures for your recovery phrase include:
- Write it down offline e.g. on a piece of paper, preferably with multiple copies stored securely in different locations
- Never store any copies of your recovery phrase online e.g. in a Google doc or Apple notes
- Move funds to a new wallet if you have to recover an existing wallet using your recovery phrase

**TO RESEARCH**

In Metamask, the private keys derived from the recovery phrase are stored in the user’s browser and they are not sent to an external server, for security reasons. The private keys are used to sign transactions in the user’s browser before broadcasting them to the Ethereum network. Metamask allows for creating multiple accounts where each account has its own pair of private and public keys that can be derived from the recovery phrase.
