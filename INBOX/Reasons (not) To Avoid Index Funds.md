# Reasons (not) To Avoid Index Funds
As of the end of 2018, only 11.5% of Canadian investment fund assets, that is mutual fund and ETF assets domiciled in Canada, were invested in index funds.

Argument that holding index funds means holding the market and its ups and downs vs. actively selecting better stocks. The story does not hold up well according to studies. Active funds does not provide better protection when stocks fall than index funds.

Active risk is not a priced risk. It does not have a positive expected return.

The quality of a company is not the same as the quality of its stock returns.

Using CRSP stocks data from 1926 to 2015, only 1000 stocks out of 26000 generated returns in excess of treasury bills.

A relatively small number of stocks drive the market's returns. How to tell which stocks to pick? It is next to impossible to consistently identify those stocks ahead of time.

Mark Carhartt 1997 paper: any persitence in mutual fund outperformance was not due to manager skill but due to exposure to common stock factors such as size, value and momentum.

Fama and French 2010 paper: skilled managers are not skilled enough to cover their own costs.

To be statistically significant at a 95% confidence level on a manager skill, it would require 36 years of 2% alpha with 6% active risk.

tldr: only a handful of stocks drives up the index. If you miss these stocks, you will fall behind the index.
