# Top Crypto Lending Platforms

### What is Crypto Lending (What are Crypto Lending Platforms)?
There are two types of crypto lending platforms.

Centralized platforms like BlockFi decide who can take out a loan and what the interest rate will be. These centralized platforms often require KYC, and they may block certain users from using their service.

Decentralized platforms like MakerDAO are governed by smart contracts. Anyone in the world can earn interest or take out a loan, so long as they have crypto. There is no KYC, and nobody can block a loan from being originated.

### Is Crypto Lending Safe?
Decentralized platforms are great because anyone can use them, but they can be buggy, are not always easy to use, and some users have even lost funds.

Centralized platforms tend to be more secure and have insurance against loss, but they restrict who can take out loans and may charge a higher rate for a loan than a decentralized platform.

### How Do Crypto Lending Platforms Work?
Crypto lending platforms enable borrowers to deposit crypto and then take out a loan. This is called a collateralized or secured loan, because there is an asset securing it. A mortgage is also a secured loan, as the value of the house secures the loan. A credit card is an unsecured loan, since the credit is not secured by any asset.

### How Do Crypto Lending Platforms Make Money?
Although different crypto lending platforms use different models, the general idea is that a platform makes a profit by collecting a middleman fee.

### Top 5 Crypto Lending Platforms
#### MakerDAO
MakerDAO is the first DeFi (Decentralized Finance) platform to accrue $1 billion worth of assets. Although the math that supports MakerDAO is complex, the idea behind the platform is surprisingly simple.

Traders deposit crypto, mostly Ethereum (ETH), and in return, they can mint the stablecoin DAI, which mirrors the value of 1 US dollar (1 DAI = 1 dollar). The minimum collateralization rate is 150% so for each $1.50 worth of crypto a trader deposits, they can mint $1 worth of DAI.

However, it’s recommended to maintain a collateralization rate of 300% or more. Recently a lot of traders had their loans closed out when the price of Ethereum collapsed on black Thursday.

Currently, the cost of borrowing on the Maker platform is 0% which is great for borrowers. However, this rate fluctuates wildly and has been as high as 20%.

MakerDAO also allows investors to deposit DAI to earn interest. The current interest rate on deposits is 0%, but this will rise as the borrowing rate rises. 

#### BlockFi
BlockFi is a crypto lending platform for a person with a lot of crypto. For example, an investor who has 10 Bitcoin and wants to use his or her BTC to collateralize a car loan.  

Like other cryptocurrency lending platforms, BlockFi requires the loan to be overcollateralized. For example, a $50,000 loan on BlockFi would require at least $100,000 worth of ETH or BTC. The minimum loan amount on BlockFi is $5,000.

BlockFi also pays interest on crypto deposits. They’re currently paying 8.6% on deposits and they accept the following assets BTC, ETH, LTC, USDC, GUSD, PAX

#### Celsius Network
Celsius promises some of the lowest borrowing rates out of any crypto platform. Currently, it’s just 1% interest to take out a crypto loan on their platform. Lenders also have it good as it’s possible to earn up to 10% on crypto deposits with Celsius. As with every platform, these rates can change quickly based on supply and demand.

The advantage of using Celsius is that they support so many crypto assets.

#### Nexo
Nexo is another crypto lending and borrowing platform that’s quite popular, especially in Europe. Currently, the borrowing rate on Nexo is 5.9% while the saving rate is an awesome 10%.

Unlike other platforms, Nexo is fully insured against losses which is a very desirable perk. Nexo also offers a crypto banking card. This makes their platform ideal for investors who want to easily spend their crypto.

#### Compound Finance
Recently, Compound has become one of the most popular crypto lending platforms thanks mainly to the distribution of the COMP token. In order to decentralize their platform and get more people involved in governance, Compound decided to airdrop (give for free) COMP to lenders and borrowers on their platform.

This incentivized investors to use the Compound platform and proved to be one of the major drivers of the yield farming craze.

Yield farming aside, Compound originates loans and pays interest on deposited assets just like any other crypto lending platform. At the time of writing, Compound pays 3% on DAI deposits and charges 4% for a DAI loan. Current market rates are [available here](https://compound.finance/markets).

### Bitcoin Lending Platforms
BlockFi is the most popular Bitcoin lending platform since they store the Bitcoin securely and have insurance to guarantee against losses.

However, another option is to convert BTC into an Ethereum token like WBTC and then use that in DeFi. Since smart contracts cannot yet be written on top of Bitcoin, there is no possibility of the Bitcoin network developing its own DeFi network.

### Is Bitcoin Lending Safe?
The problem with Bitcoin lending is that it will always be controlled by a centralized company like BlockFi. That means KYC and the collection of user data. This data is vulnerable to theft as BlockFi learned when they were hacked in May of 2020. While the hacker didn’t steal any BTC, they did steal personal information like the names and addresses of account holders.

Data storage aside, Bitcoin lending can be safe because centralized companies tend to store Bitcoin securely. They also keep insurance against losses, similar to a regular bank account.

### Crypto Loans without Collateral
Platforms like Aave have begun to offer “undercollateralized” crypto loans, which is the first step toward non-collateralized loans. However, as of yet crypto credit lines without collateral do not exist.
