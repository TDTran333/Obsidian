# What Is a Veblen Good?
A Veblen good is a good for which demand increases as the price increases, because of its exclusive nature and appeal as a status symbol. A Veblen goodÂ has an upward-sloping demand curve, which runs counter to the typical downward-sloping curve. However, a Veblen good is generally a high-quality, coveted product, in contrast to a Giffen good, which is an inferior product that does not have easily available substitutes.
