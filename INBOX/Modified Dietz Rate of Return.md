# Modified Dietz Rate of Return

The Modified Dietz rate of return attempts to estimate a money-weighted rate of return (MWRR) by weighting each cash flow by the proportion of the measurement period it is present or absent from the portfolio.

Similar to the money-weighted rate of return, the calculation requires the investor to know the portfolio values at the start and end of the measurement period, as well as the cash flow amounts and dates when each cash flow occurs. Â Unlike the MWRR, the calculation does not require an exhaustive trial and error procedure, or sophisticated computing power.
