**Bradley in St. Louis:** What's actually in the Georgia voting law that everyone is arguing about? 

**Morning Brew:** Many readers had questions about the specifics of this law, so let's dive in. High level, this GOP bill has been criticized by voting rights activists for placing new curbs on voting, while Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp insists it expands access.

Here are some of the main changes:

-   **Limits on absentee ballots:** The law shrinks the window for voters to request mail-in ballots, allows officials to send ballots only to voters who request them, and introduces ID requirements in place of signature matching.  
-   **Power to the state government:** Power over local elections is being stripped from the secretary of state, an elected position, and transferred to a newly created position that's _appointed_. Critics say this removes the nonpartisan flavor of election governance.
-   **No food in line:** The law bans handing out food or drink within 150 feet of a polling place or within 25 feet of any voter.
-   **More access in some cases:** The GA law guarantees a minimum # of drop boxes for mail ballots per county, expands early voting in most small counties, and adds more resources to polling places where lines get long.

The context is crucial. The US has a long history of suppressing voting access for Black and minority populations, and critics say this law continues that practice. It was also drafted after some GOP lawmakers lobbed baseless allegations of voter fraud during the 2020 election.

Republican supporters of the law say Democrats are spinning false narratives to score political points.
