# Log2
If you use log-transformed expression (or concentration) values, you model PROPORTIONAL chances rather than additive changes. This is typically biologically more relevant.

A doubling (or the reduction to 50%) is often considered as a biologically relevant change. On the **log2** scale this translates to one unit (+1 or -1). That's a simple value, easy to recall, and it is more "fine grained" than using higher bases (like log10).
