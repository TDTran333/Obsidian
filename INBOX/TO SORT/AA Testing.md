# A/A Testing

### What Is A/A Testing?

A/A testing is the tactic of using [A/B testing](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/ab-testing/) to test two identical versions of a page against each other. Typically, this is done to check that the tool being used to run the experiment is statistically fair. In an A/A test, the tool should report no difference in conversions between the control and variation, if the test is implemented correctly.
