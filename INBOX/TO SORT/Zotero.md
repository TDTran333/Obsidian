"We define the outperformance (resp. underperformance) of an investment
fund as the percentage of funds in the peer universe for which the true
performance of the focal fund is higher (resp. lower). We show that the
p-values of the pairwise tests of equal performance can be used to
obtain estimates of the out- and underperformance ratio that are robust
to false discoveries - estimated alpha differentials for which the
significance test has a low p-value while the true alpha is identical.
When applied to hedge funds, we find that ranking funds on the
outperformance ratio leads to a top quintile portfolio with a higher
absolute and risk-adjusted performance than when the estimated alpha is
used." (Ardia and Boudt 2018:351
