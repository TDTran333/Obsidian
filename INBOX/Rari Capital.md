# Rari Capital
- Rari Capital holds $112M in its smart contracts.
- Bhavnani sees the yield aggregator as the middle piece in a three part stack, with capital onboarding like Coinbase or MetaMask on top, and the protocols into which the aggregator deploys on the bottom.
- “You’re never going to get value in this middle stack and you’re never going to be able to stay competitive besides just competing for fees over and over again.”
- As such, he thinks Yearn Finance will fall victim to competitors copying their strategies with lower fees, creating a race to the bottom.
- “We want to control this entire stack: capital onboarding, capital formation, and capital deployment,” the co-founder said.
- A new product, Fuse, which allows users to create their own borrowing and lending pools, constitutes the bottom of the stack. Rari’s yield aggregator can deposit into its own Fuse pools, generating yield without money leaving the protocol.
