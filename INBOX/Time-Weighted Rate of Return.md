# Time-Weighted Rate of Return

You calculate the time-weighted rate of return in three broad steps: 
* First, you divide your reporting period into sub-periods – one for each time you made a contribution or withdrawal. 
* Next, you calculate a mini-total return for each sub-period. 
* You then “geometrically link” each of these mini-returns to arrive at the time-weighted rate of return over the entire period.

The way we calculate the time-weighted rate of return is supposed to wipe out the effect of individual contributions and withdrawals. This makes the time-weighted rate of return ideal for benchmarking different portfolio and fund managers. It’s especially good at comparing various active managers’ investment strategies.
