# What Are Cryptographic Hash Functions?
A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical function used in cryptography. Typical hash functions take inputs of variable lengths to return outputs of a fixed length.

A cryptographic hash function combines the message-passing capabilities of hash functions with security properties.

### Key Takeaways
-   Hash functions are mathematical functions that transform or "map" a given set of data into a bit string of fixed size, also known as the "hash value."
-   Hash functions are used in cryptography and have variable levels of complexity and difficulty.
-   Hash functions are used for cryptocurrency, password security, and message security.
