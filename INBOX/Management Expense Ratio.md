 The Management Expense Ratio (MER) is the percentage of the annual fees plus the annual expenses, divided by the average net assets of the fund. 

The MER is accrued in the fund before the returns are calculated and reported. Investment returns reflect performance reported after the MER is deducted.

The MER covers three crucial elements of managing your mutual funds: Management Fees, Operating Expenses and Taxes on both of these .

**Management Fees**
Investment Management Fees
Fees paid to the asset management firm that manages the fund. Covers investment research, strategy development and implementation, investment selection, portfolio management and monitoring, and governance and risk management involved with managing all of the money in the fund.

Trailing Commission/Service Fee
Compensation to the firm that sells the fund. Fee s paid for the investment advice and service provided to you.

Operating Expenses
Covers costs associated with regulatory requirements and day-to-day expenses of operating the fund. These can include bookkeeping and administrative fees, marketing costs, regulatory document filings, transaction processing, client reporting, audit and legal fees, and custodial fees

Taxes
Each fund is required to pay sales tax on management fees and operating expenses.

### Trailing commissions
Most mutual funds pay a trailing commission (or trailer fee) each year to the company that sold you the fund. They pay this commission for as long as you hold the fund. The rate of the trailing commission is set by the fund company.

-   It’s paid out of the fund’s management fee so it’s reflected in the fund’s MER.
-   It typically ranges from 0.25% to 1.5% of the value of your investment each year.
-   It is to pay for the services and advice the company and the advisor provide to you.
-   The company may pay all or part of the commission to your financial advisor.

### Sales charges
You may pay a sales charge when you buy or sell units or shares of a fund. These sales charges are also known as loads. Funds may be offered with a front-end load, back-end load, low load or no load. These sales charges are set by the mutual fund company.

Loads are fees charged to the investor when buying or selling certain types of mutual funds. The purpose of loads is to pay a broker or advisor for their services. Therefore, unless you are working with a broker or advisor, you should not pay loads of any kind. 

#### 4 types of sales charges
1.  **Front-end load or initial sales charge (ISC)** – Some mutual funds charge a fee when you buy your units or shares. This is a percentage (up to 5%) of the amount that you are investing in the fund. The fee is paid to the investment firm that sells you the fund. You can negotiate this fee with your advisor.
2.  **Back-end load or deferred sales charge (DSC)** – Some funds charge a fee of up to 6% when you sell your units or shares. Here’s how it works:
    -   The longer you hold a fund with a DSC, the less you’ll be charged when you sell it. The fee declines every year according to a fixed schedule.
    -   If you hold it long enough (usually between 5 and 7 years), you won’t pay a fee when you sell your units or shares.
    -   Some fund companies may also let you take some of your money (usually 10%) out of the fund each year without charging you a fee.
    -   Your advisor’s firm receives commission (usually about 5%) up front from the mutual fund company when you buy the fund. Your advisor receives part of this commission. Any deferred sales charge you pay goes to the mutual fund company.
3.  **Low load or low sales charge (LSC)** – Low load funds charge a lower sales charge (up to 3%) when you buy your units or shares, and a lower redemption fee (up to 3%) when you sell them. You usually won’t have to pay a redemption fee if you hold your units or shares for at least 3 years.
4.  **No load** – A no load fund doesn’t charge a fee when you buy or sell its units or shares. A no load fund may not always be a better deal than a load fund. You should compare the MER and performance of each fund before you decide.

### Summary
