# 27 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR CURIOUS INVESTORS

## Cryptocurrencies 101
All cryptocurrencies—also known as digital assets—share two key qualities
* First, they are built on blockchains, an emerging digital technology.
* Second, they reflect a conviction that digitalization is here to stay.

### What's a blockchain?
A blockchain is a technological protocol—a ruleset—that combines cryptography and economic incentives to enforce collective agreement on information in computer networks.

### Whats the difference?
The modern world is built around entities who facilitate trust between parties and who maintain collective information, like records of credits and debits, signatures on contracts, and the enforcement of contracts. Blockchains represent a different architecture: Because collective information is maintained by default, central entities that maintain information become redundant.

### Have the technology taken off?
Blockchains are like plumbing; if they run smoothly, a user shouldn’t hear about them. Much of the early blockchain adoption has occurred quietly.

Blockchains still have limitations, particularly in meeting the scale and privacy demands of would-be users such as banks, payment processors, and websites.

### What is cryptocurrency?
A cryptocurrency is a form of non-sovereign money built using cryptography rather than trust between institutions. 

### What is a bitcoin?
Bitcoin was the first widespread application of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was conceived as “peer-to-peer” electronic cash for the internet, meaning that people can exchange it without need for a bank, a government, or another intermediary. Transactions on the bitcoin ledger are permanent, auditable, encrypted, and distributed. Importantly, the Bitcoin blockchain has never been hacked.

### What is web 3.0?
**Web 1.0** 
* Syntactic web or “read-only web.” 
* 1991–2004
* role of a user is limited to reading information provided by the content producers
* consumers of content
* static websites

**Web 2.0** 
* Social web or "read-write” web"
* 2004-now
* interaction between web users and sites
* user can be a content producers and content is distributed and shared between sites
* social-networking profiles

**Web 2.5** 
* focus on mobile computing and evolution in mobile technologies

**Web 3.0** 
* Semantic web or "read-write-execute” web"
* intelligently generate and distribute useful content tailored to a particular need of a user with Ai and ML
* Content is accessible by multiple applications, every device is connected to the web, the services can be used everywhere
* That vision might not come to pass
* Another vision: construct a peer-to-peer web that lets you do everything you can now, except there would no servers and no authorities to manage the flow of information
* decentralized net

Ethereum was the first platform for the building of decentralized applications using “smart contracts”—self-executing code that automatically implements the terms of agreements between parties. These contracts have the potential to streamline processes across the business world.

### What's are digital payment assets?
The race for digital payments broadly splits into two categories: central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and “stablecoins” on public blockchains.

Bitcoin forced central banks to recognize that cryptographic payment rails are more efficient than legacy payment rails. More than 80% of central banks globally are studying or developing their own CBDC according to the Bank for International Settlements. CBDCs are blockchain-inspired, but do not need to live on blockchains. According to a European Union task force, CBDCs stand to “provide state-of-the-art payment services”, “increase choice, competition, and accessibility”, and “reduce overall costs and ecological footprint of the monetary and payment systems.

Stablecoins—dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDC, Tether, Dai, Celo, and Diem—live on public open-source blockchains like Ethereum.

### What makes bitcoin attractive as a hedge?
As a hedge, bitcoin is perhaps best compared with gold; quantities are limited and no government controls the supply. 

Its lack of correlation to the more common assets in investors’ portfolios provide diversification.

### Why not buy gold instead?
Unlike gold, bitcoin is a fully digital asset that can be effortlessly stored, transferred, and divided.

### How can bitcoin be a “hard asset” when there’snothing physical backing it? Can’t it just disappear?
Physical assets can be seen and touched, but they can still disappear—they can be stolen, lost, confiscated, degraded, or destroyed. Fixed-code cryptocurrency is digital, but it is still a real asset. Bitcoin transactions are permanently and publicly recorded on an immutable ledger, and the transactions are cryptographically secured and validated.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are sometimes traded on exchanges or kept in digital wallets, which have occasionally been subject to hacks and fraud. But the Bitcoin blockchain itself has never been hacked.

### Why should I invest in such a highlyvolatile asset?
Bitcoin’s volatility is likely to decline as bitcoin’s market matures and more experienced and established investors establish positions. For example, two of the largest U.S. conventional commodities exchanges, the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the CME Group exchange, now offer bitcoin futures, and CME has also launched federally regulated bitcoin options.

### What does the “smart money” thinkabout bitcoin and cryptocurrency?
In a survey of 150 endowments in 2018, 94% said they had invested in crypto-related initiatives. 

In a pre-pandemic survey of 800 U.S. and European institutional investors, 36% said they were already invested in digital assets, and six out of 10 agreed that they have a place in their portfolio.

December 2020 survey of RIAs, 62% said they are likely to allocate client portfolios to bitcoin within the next 12 months.

Hedge Funds are also investing.

### Why invest in decentralized internet(Web 3.0) cryptocurrencies?
Web 3.0 cryptocurrencies support the development of a decentralized internet.

### Why invest in digital payment assets?
The global financial industry is ripe for disruption. Payment systems are inefficient, error-prone, and insecure. Underserved people who lack government identification or access to a banking institution are often excluded entirely from the financial system.

Generally speaking, digital payment asset investment is a bet on the disruption of the finance industry and the power of decentralized finance. The public’s growing comfort with handling their finances entirely digitally should help to promote the acceptance of digital payment assets.

### Why were cryptocurrencies developed?
Prior to the advent of cryptocurrency, conventional financial technologies like online payment apps worked with traditional currencies and established financial and payment systems. These apps involve a whole host of intermediaries, including governments that can manipulate the value of currency and banks that charge fees and have been known to compromise customer data. 

Cryptocurrencies, by contrast, are built on cryptography—code for storing and transmitting data so that it can be read only by those for whom it is intended. They make it possible to transact globally and instantly, without banks or governments acting as intermediaries

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work.”
"With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third-party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless."

### How is bitcoin “mined”?
In a traditional financial transaction, a middleman is charged with executing and validating the trade. The middleman is entrusted with personal data and takes a profit for the work. 

On the Bitcoin blockchain, that work is done by a network of “miners” who are rewarded with bitcoin units. Miners run powerful computers tasked with solving a complex mathematical computation that cryptographically assures the security of a transaction and adds it to the blockchain’s ledger.

The computers’ heavy use of electricity to mine bitcoin has led some to criticize bitcoin’s contribution to climate change.

Roughly two-thirds of bitcoin mining takes place in China.

The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, ether, plans to switch to a different type of mining that promises to reduce power usage by 99%.

### Isn’t bitcoin often used by criminal enterprises?
Last year, illicit activity made up 0.34% of all cryptocurrency transaction   
volume, according to a report from blockchain data firm Chainalysis. That was   
down from roughly 2 % a year earlier.

### Haven’t cryptocurrency ownerslost money through hacks?
Hacks or fraud have occurred on unsecured, unregulated exchanges over the years.
New cryptocurrency investment vehicles don’t require investors to wrestle with digital wallets or vet the security of exchanges. Instead, they can invest in professionally managed funds in which custodial services, auditing, and tax reporting are performed by well-established names

### Aren’t cryptocurrencies just a fad, or only of interest to die-hard techies?

### Why are larger investors takingan interest in cryptocurrency?

### If I’m convinced bitcoin deserves a place in my portfolio, how much should I invest?
Despite its volatility, adding a small portfolio allocation to bitcoin generally increases overall expected return when adjusted for risk. It also potentially diversifies some of the inherent systemic risk in the financial system that exists in most investors’ portfolios.

The strongest marginal improvement occurs in the 0.5% to 2.5% range.

### How should the allocation be managed?

### With so many cryptocurrencies poppingup, how do I know which will be winners?

### What are some of the optionsfor buying cryptocurrency?
Currently the most popular venue for buying cryptocurrencies are exchanges. The most popular of these peer-to-peer markets have tens of millions of accounts, rivaling the largest stock brokerages. 

Exchanges facilitate instantaneous, 24/7 trading of hundreds of cryptocurrencies. But many exchanges are themselves startup companies whose long-term survival is not guaranteed. Some exchanges have closed due to hacks or fraud; quoted prices may vary between exchanges; and transaction fees vary widely.

Security remains a significant issue with some exchanges. Cryptocurrency “wallets” are accessed through private keys. If these long strings of alphanumeric characters are lost or stolen, the currency cannot be retrieved. Some exchanges allow traders to store their private keys online, where they are subject to theft. Traders who keep their private keys offline must store them with extreme care. 

Managing tax reporting is another potential drawback for exchange users. The onus is typically on the user to understand and manage tax documentation, which can be challenging as the cryptocurrency tax landscape continually evolves.

### What’s the alternative to exchanges?
Alternatives have emerged for individuals who are interested in investing in—rather than merely trading—cryptocurrency. They don’t require owners to manage wallets, and the private keys are secured offline by a professional custodian.
