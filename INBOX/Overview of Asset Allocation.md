# Overview of Asset Allocation
### Introduction
Asset owners are concerned with accumulating and maintaining the wealth needed to meet their needs and aspirations. In that endeavor, investment portfolios—including individuals’ portfolios and institutional funds—play important roles. Asset allocation is a strategic—and often a first or early—decision in portfolio construction. Because it holds that position, it is widely accepted as important and meriting careful attention. Among the questions addressed in this reading are the following:

-   What is a sound governance context for making asset allocation decisions?
-   How broad a picture should an adviser have of an asset owner’s assets and liabilities in recommending an asset allocation?
-   How can an asset owner’s objectives and sensitivities to risk be represented in asset allocation?
-   What are the broad approaches available in developing an asset allocation recommendation, and when might one approach be more or less appropriate than another?
-   What are the top-level decisions that need to be made in implementing a chosen asset allocation?
-   How may asset allocations be rebalanced as asset prices change?

The strategic asset allocation decision determines return levels in which allocations are invested, irrespective of the degree of active management. Because of its strategic importance, the investment committee, at the highest level of the governance hierarchy, typically retains approval of the strategic asset allocation decision. Often a proposal is developed only after a formal asset allocation study that incorporates obligations, objectives, and constraints; simulates possible investment outcomes over an agreed-on investment horizon; and evaluates the risk and return characteristics of the possible allocation strategies.

### Structure of readings

### Summary
* Effective investment governance ensures that decisions are made by individuals or groups with the necessary skills and capacity and involves articulating the long- and short-term objectives of the investment program; effectively allocating decision rights and responsibilities among the functional units in the governance hierarchy; taking account of their knowledge, capacity, time, and position on the governance hierarchy; specifying processes for developing and approving the investment policy statement, which will govern the day-to-day operation of the investment program; specifying processes for developing and approving the program’s strategic asset allocation; establishing a reporting framework to monitor the program’s progress toward the agreed-on goals and objectives; and periodically undertaking a governance audit.

* The economic balance sheet includes non-financial assets and liabilities that can be relevant for choosing the best asset allocation for an investor’s financial portfolio.

* The investment objectives of asset-only asset allocation approaches focus on the asset side of the economic balance sheet; approaches with a liability-relative orientation focus on funding liabilities; and goals-based approaches focus on achieving financial goals.

* The risk concepts relevant to asset-only asset allocation approaches focus on asset risk; those of liability-relative asset allocation focus on risk in relation to paying liabilities; and a goals-based approach focuses on the probabilities of not achieving financial goals.

* Asset classes are the traditional units of analysis in asset allocation and reflect systematic risks with varying degrees of overlap.

* Assets within an asset class should be relatively homogeneous; asset classes should be mutually exclusive; asset classes should be diversifying; asset classes as a group should make up a preponderance of the world’s investable wealth; asset classes selected for investment should have the capacity to absorb a meaningful proportion of an investor’s portfolio.

* Risk factors are associated with non-diversifiable (i.e., systematic) risk and are associated with an expected return premium. The price of an asset and/or asset class may reflect more than one risk factor, and complicated spread positions may be necessary to identify and isolate particular risk factors. Their use as units of analysis in asset allocation is driven by considerations of controlling systematic risk exposures.

* The global market portfolio represents a highly diversified asset allocation that can serve as a baseline asset allocation in an asset-only approach.

* There are two dimensions of passive/active choices. One dimension relates to the management of the strategic asset allocation itself—for example, whether to deviate from it tactically or not. The second dimension relates to passive and active implementation choices in investing the allocation to a given asset class. Tactical and dynamic asset allocation relate to the first dimension; active and passive choices for implementing allocations to asset classes relate to the second dimension.

* Risk budgeting addresses the question of which types of risks to take and how much of each to take. Active risk budgeting addresses the question of how much benchmark-relative risk an investor is willing to take. At the level of the overall asset allocation, active risk can be defined relative to the strategic asset allocation benchmark. At the level of individual asset classes, active risk can be defined relative to the benchmark proxy.

* Rebalancing is the discipline of adjusting portfolio weights to more closely align with the strategic asset allocation. Rebalancing approaches include calendar-based and range-based rebalancing. Calendar-based rebalancing rebalances the portfolio to target weights on a periodic basis. Range-based rebalancing sets rebalancing thresholds or trigger points around target weights. The ranges may be fixed width, percentage based, or volatility based. Range-based rebalancing permits tighter control of the asset mix compared with calendar rebalancing.

* Strategic considerations in rebalancing include transaction costs, risk aversion, correlations among asset classes, volatility, and beliefs concerning momentum, taxation, and asset class liquidity.




### THE INVESTMENT GOVERNANCE BACKGROUND TO ASSET ALLOCATION
#### 3.1 Governance Structures
Governance hierarchy:
* Governing investment committee
* Investment staff
* Third-party resources

Governance tasks:
* Articulate the long- and short-term objectives of the investment program.
* Allocate decision rights and responsibilities among the functional units in the governance hierarchy effectively, taking account of their knowledge, capacity, time, and position in the governance hierarchy.
* Specify processes for developing and approving the investment policy statement that will govern the day-to- day operations of the investment program.
* Specify processes for developing and approving the program’s strategic asset allocation.
* Establish a reporting framework to monitor the program’s progress toward the agreed- on goals and objectives.
* Periodically undertake a governance audit.

#### 3.2 Articulating Investment Objectives
Investment objective statement:
* Defined benefit pension fund. The investment objective of the fund is to ensure that plan assets are sufficient to meet current and future pension liabilities.
* Endowment fund. The investment objective of the endowment is to earn a rate of return in excess of the return required to fund, after accounting for inflation, ongoing distributions consistent with the endowment’s mission.
* Individual investor. The investment objective is to provide for retirement at the investor’s desired retirement age, family needs, and bequests, subject to stated risk tolerance and investment constraints.

A return requirement is often considered the essence of an investment objective statement, but for that portion of the objective statement to be properly understood requires additional context.

The ultimate goal is to find the best risk/return trade- off consistent with the asset owner’s resource constraints and risk tolerance.

#### 3.3 Allocation of Rights and Responsibilities
Allocation of rights and responsibilities across the governance hierarchy is a key element in the success of an investment program. Effective governance requires that the individuals charged with any given decision have the required knowledge and expertise to thoroughly evaluate the alternative courses of action and the capacity to take on the ongoing responsibility of those decisions, and they must be able to execute those decisions in a timely fashion.

#### 3.4 Investment Policy Statement
The investment policy statement (IPS) is the foundation of an effective investment program. A well- crafted IPS can serve as a blueprint for ongoing fund management and assures stakeholders that program assets are managed with the appropriate care and diligence.

#### 3.5 Asset Allocation and Rebalancing Policy
Because of its strategic importance, the investment committee, at the highest level of the governance hierarchy, typically retains approval of the strategic asset allocation decision. A proposal is often developed only after a formal asset allocation study that incorporates obligations, objectives, and constraints; simulates possible investment outcomes over an agreed- on investment horizon; and evaluates the risk and return characteristics of the possible allocation strategies.

#### 3.6 Reporting Framework
Answer clearly, concisely and accurately:
* Where are we now?
* Where are we relative to the goals and objectives?
* What value has been added or subtracted by management decisions?

**Benchmarking** is necessary for performance measurement, attribution, and evaluation. Effective benchmarking allows the investment committee to evaluate staff and external managers. Two separate levels of benchmarks are appropriate: one that measures the success of the investment managers relative to the purpose for which they were hired and another to measure the gap between the policy portfolio and the portfolio as actually implemented.

**Management reporting**, typically prepared by staff with input from consultants and custodians, provides responsible parties with the information necessary to understand which parts of the portfolio are performing ahead of or behind the plan and why, as well as whether assets are being managed in accordance with investment guidelines.

**Governance reporting**, which addresses strengths and weaknesses in program execution, should be structured in such a way that regular committee meetings can efficiently address any concerns. Although a crisis might necessitate calling an extraordinary meeting, good governance structures minimize this need.

#### 3.7 The Governance Audit
The purpose of the governance audit is to ensure that the established policies, procedures, and governance structures are effective. The audit should be performed by an independent third party.

Good governance seeks to avoid decision-reversal  risk — the risk of reversing a chosen course of action at exactly the wrong time, the point of maximum loss.

Good investment governance also considers the effect of investment committee member and staff turnover on the durability of the investment program and prevents key person risk.

Blame avoidance (not accepting personal responsibility when appropriate to do so) is a common feature of institutional investors. Good governance works to prevent such behavior.
