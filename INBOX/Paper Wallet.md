# Paper Wallet

A **paper wallet** is the name given to an obsolete and unsafe method of storing bitcoin which was popular between 2011 and 2016. It works by having a single private key and bitcoin address, usually generated by a website, being printed out onto **paper**. This method has a large number of downsides and should not be used.
