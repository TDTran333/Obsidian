# Why Delaware is the most attractive place to incorporate a company
According to the Tax Justice Network, an advocacy group that tracks tax avoidance, the US is now the second-largest tax haven in the world, trailing only the Cayman Islands.

**1.5m businesses** from all over the world are incorporated in Delaware, including **68%** of all Fortune 500 firms.
One adress, 1209 North Orange Street,  is the official incorporation address of 285k+ companies.
### Delaware Loophole
Adopted in 1899, the **Delaware General Corporation Law** “reduced restrictions upon corporate action to a minimum” and promised to maintain the most hospitable business enclave in the nation.

In Delaware, **intangible assets** — think trademarks, copyrights, and leases — **are free from taxation**. Companies will often transfer these assets to a Delaware subsidiary and pay their _own_ subsidiary for the rights to use said assets. This saves them money on both ends:
1. The company can write off these payments in its home state, dramatically lowering its tax bill.			
2. The company isn’t taxed on its dealings in Delaware.

Incorporating in Delaware comes with a slew of other tax perks, including:
-   No state corporate income tax
-   No sales tax
-   No tax on interest/other investment income
-   No value-added taxes
-   No personal property tax
-   No inheritance tax

Instead, all a business pays is a franchise tax (\$175-\$180k, depending on size) and small agent, annual report, and registration fees.

For the state of Delaware, these small fees add up to as much as 41% of the state’s entire revenue. In 2019, they collectively amounted to $1.4B. It has been estimated that the Delaware loophole costs other states as much as $9.5B per year in collective lost tax revenue.

### Corporate privacy and expediency
But taxes aren’t the main benefit of incorporating in Delaware: Most businesses are in it for privacy and courts.

When a company wants to incorporate in Delaware, it works through a registered agent —  a person in the state who acts as a middleman, collecting paperwork and providing the company with a physical address.

In Delaware, the incorporation process can take **less than one hour** to complete — and the state doesn’t require companies to disclose the names of officers and directors, allowing for **anonymity**.

### A favorable court system
Corporate lawsuits are resolved by the court’s judges — who specialize in corporate law — rather than juries. While the average civil trial in America can take 2-3 years to resolve, Delaware’s process is far more expedient.

Many legal experts claim that these courts are overwhelmingly favorable to corporations — particularly when it comes to shareholder disputes.
