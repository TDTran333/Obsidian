# Should You Buy Bitcoin in Your TFSA and RRSP?

## Should You Hold Bitcoin in Your Registered Account?
The new Bitcoin ETF lets you buy Bitcoin in both registered and unregistered accounts—meaning you can tax-shelter your investment in a TFSA or RRSP.

## Do I Have to Claim Bitcoin on My Taxes?
However, if you do not_hold Bitcoin in your TFSA or RRSP, cryptocurrency gains on cryptocurrency exchange platforms are taxable. The CRA recognizes cryptocurrency gains as either business income or capital gains, depending on the circumstances.

## Will I Have to Pay Capital Gains Selling Bitcoin in a TFSA or RRSP?
All capital gains are tax-free in a TFSA. If you buy the Bitcoin ETF in your RRSP and it increases in value, you won’t pay any income taxes on those gains until you actually make a withdrawal in retirement.

## What Are the Risks of Buying Bitcoin in my TFSA or RRSP?
Cryptocurrency is still a high-risk, speculative asset that is incredibly volatile. An investment loss is not the same as a withdrawal: you don’t recoup the contribution room the following year.

It’s also worth noting that you can only trade BTCC during market hours.
