# What is Geography? Crash Course Geography #1
The US imports more than 3 billion pounds of bananas from Guatemala each year.

In geography, human-environment interactions are all the ways human connect with and live within the environment and the impact that the environment has on lives, choices, and expereicnes of people. This is key to geographers.

We look at the confluence of space, place and human and environment intereactions and how they overlapped to bring us a story. Geography is a spacial science. Asking why here?

Geography is much more than identifying cities and countries and capitals on a map. Geographers look to find connection between the physical processes at work on earth's surface and how people use and interact with the earth.
