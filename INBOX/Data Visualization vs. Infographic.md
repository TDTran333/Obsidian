An important difference is that a data visualization is just one (i.e. a map, graph, chart or diagram), while an infographic often contains multiple data visualizations. A second key difference is that infographics contain additional elements like narrative and graphics. Besides that, more work tends to go into the design of infographics, to make them more impactful and aesthetically pleasing.

| Complexity                                               | Generally quite simple, targeting a layman audience                           | Vary greatly in complexity, from simple bar charts to highly complex scientific visualizations                                                                               |

| Design and aesthetics                                    | Often a lot of work goes into the design and making it aesthetically pleasing | These are for the most part automatically generated using Excel, StatPlanet, or other software; if published or used in presentations, more attention is paid to the design. |
| Includes meta data, e.g. units, source, definitions | Sometimes                                                                     | Generally considered to be external to the data visualization (and often excluded)                                                                                           |

| Interactive                                              | Rarely, infographics are normally static images.                              | Increasingly so in web-based data visualizations - this is the future of datavis                                                                                             |
