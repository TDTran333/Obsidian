# 3 Principles of Successful Investors
The success of the investor tends to result more from their behaviour than from the specific investments they own.

### 1. Faith
The single most important characteristic of successful investors is faith. This includes faith in the markets, in the future, in our free enterprise system, in the ability of good companies to grow their profits, and in humanity.

The reason this is so important is that one of the single most important factors in investing is to stay invested and keep investing at market lows.

### 2. Patience
Successful investors tend to focus on having high quality investments and/or advice, and tend to stick with them long term. Part of their belief system is that they don’t know when it’s going to turn out all right – they just know that it’s going to turn out all right.

### 3. Discipline
Discipline is the decision to keep doing the right things. It is the decision not to do something wrong.

### Summary
In short, the behaviour and the belief system of the investor are the key factors in superior lifetime investment returns.
