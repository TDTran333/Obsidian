# Net Asset Value (NAV)

Net asset value (NAV) represents a fund's per share market value. It is the price at which investors buy ("bid price") fund shares from a fund company and sell them ("redemption price") to a fund company. It is derived by dividing the total value of all the cash and securities in a fund's portfolio, less any liabilities, by the number of shares outstanding. A NAV computation is undertaken once at the end of each trading day based on the closing market prices of the portfolio's securities. 

### Key Takeaways
-   Net asset value (NAV) represents a fund's per share market value.
-   NAV is calculated by dividing the total value of all the cash and securities in a fund's portfolio, minus any liabilities, by the number of outstanding shares.
-   The NAV calculation is important because it tells us how much one share of the fund is worth.

The NAV doesn't provide a performance metric for the fund. The NAV of a fund should be looked at over a timeframe to assess fund performance.
