## What _is_ Greenland? 

The island that dominated the top part of the map in your high school classroom is a [semiautonomous territory](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/23486973.2126131/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLWV1cm9wZS0xODI0OTQ3ND91dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/5fe1fe5daa76d105e77713a7B829c99ea) of Denmark, not an independent country. 

It’s pretty empty: About 57,000 people live there, despite the landmass being big enough to cover more than 20% of the US. The only economic game in town is fishing, which is why Denmark provides two-thirds of Greenland’s budget and handles its monetary and military affairs.

But like Dippin' Dots, there’s so much _potential_, and that’s what this [election](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/23486973.2126131/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnByLm9yZy8yMDIxLzA0LzA2Lzk4NDc2ODAxMi9hLXJvdy1vdmVyLXJhcmUtZWFydGgtZGVwb3NpdHMtY291bGQtYnJpbmctZG93bi1ncmVlbmxhbmRzLWdvdmVybm1lbnQ_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/5fe1fe5daa76d105e77713a7Be2abb657) was all about. Greenland sits on one of the world’s biggest deposits of rare earth elements, minerals that are required for the production of modern machines like fighter planes, electric vehicles, and smartphones. 

After years of paperwork, a Chinese-backed Australian mining company was ready to tap these reserves. But then opponents called for a [snap election](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/23486973.2126131/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9jaGluYXMtcmFyZS1lYXJ0aHMtcXVlc3QtdXBlbmRzLWdyZWVubGFuZHMtZ292ZXJubWVudC0xMTYxNzgwNzgzOT91dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/5fe1fe5daa76d105e77713a7Bcf078d51) to stop the project in its tracks...and it worked. On Wednesday, the pro-environment Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) party wrested power away from the Siumut party, which had supported the project.

-   The IA party isn’t opposed to _all_ mining, just this particular development, which critics say could release radioactive waste into the fragile environment that surrounds the site.

## A lot is at stake 

For Greenland and for the US, China, Russia, or anyone else that considers themselves a global superpower.

**For Greenland:** Many Greenlanders want independence from Denmark, but the only way that can happen is to wean themselves off Danish payments. The economic boom generated from rare earth mines could be their ticket out. 

**For the US:** With China controlling over 70% of rare earth mining, the US is eyeing Greenland’s reserves (about 10% of the world’s rare earths) as a way to become less reliant on China for these critical raw materials.

**For the rest of the world:** Greenland is becoming the hottest destination this side of South Beach. As climate change melts away Greenland’s ice sheet, shipping routes are opening up that could [cut travel times](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/23486973.2126131/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ3plcm9tZWRpYS5jb20vcmVhZC9vdmVyLXRoZS10b3AtYXJjdGljLXNoaXBwaW5nLWxhbmVzP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/5fe1fe5daa76d105e77713a7B465a9013) from Asia to Europe in half, which, if you know anything about the traffic at the Suez Canal (and you do), is quite attractive.
