# Fundstrat's head of digital assets research walks us through his $100,000 and $10,500 year-end price targets for bitcoin and ether â€” and shares the 8 tokens he's bullish on. 

### Bitcoin
To arrive at the price model for bitcoin, he analyzed market data such as the digital token's price, market cap, and supply; financial metrics including total payment volume, transaction fee revenue, and payment processing costs; key performance indicators like transaction take rate and active bitcoin wallet users; as well as valuation metrics such as value per user and cost-savings multiple.

### Ethereum
On the other hand, Ethereum's transaction fee revenue, which has been growing at a 1,099% 5-year compound annual growth rate, ended 2020 at around $600 million, according to Grider. 

During the first 17 days of 2021, Ethereum had already recorded $180 million in cloud revenue, which implies that it could capture $3.9 billion in annualized revenue this year, he said.

Because of the plethora of decentralized finance applications built atop the network, Grider believes that Ethereum should be valued like a cloud 1.0 stock with a similar growth-adjusted price-to-sales multiple as those in the Bessemer Venture Partners (BVP) Emerging Cloud Index.

"The general theme that's emerged with this new wave of technology approaches is that they are trying to make fees cheaper and transactions faster," he said of the [DeFi projects](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-invest-defi-bitcoin-crypto-cio-launches-new-fund-2021-2).
