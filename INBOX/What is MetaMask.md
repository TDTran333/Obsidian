# What Is MetaMask?
### What Is MetaMask?
MetaMask is a popular and established browser extension which functions as a cryptocurrency wallet that connects to the Ethereum blockchain. MetaMask allows users to interact with the Ethereum ecosystem, which hosts a vast universe of decentralized applications (Dapps), without having to download the entire blockchain on their device. As such, it’s the one of the best Ethereum wallet solutions for easy access to decentralized exchanges (DEX), gaming platforms, gambling sites and many other applications.

Apart from storing Ethereum’s native currency, ETH, MetaMask also holds tokens that are built on the protocol’s [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) and [ERC-721](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-721) standards. MetaMask was founded by Aaron Davis and the blockchain company ConsenSys.
 
 ### Key Features
According to an independent audit by Least Authority, a security company, the Ethereum online wallet provides top-of-the-line features and functionalities in terms of security and design.

A feature that makes MetaMask a top Ethereum wallet is its outstanding encryption technology, which securely stores passwords and private keys in each user’s device. Moreover, it allows users to connect multiple wallets and switch between the Ethereum mainnet, major testnets, and even the Binance Smart Chain mainnet.

### MetaMask vs Trust Wallet
Another wallet compatible with the Ethereum blockchain is Trust Wallet, which has some fundamental differences with MetaMask. For instance, while MetaMask is both a browser and mobile-based wallet, Trust Wallet is only available on mobile. Additionally, Trust Wallet supports more than just Ethereum and its assets. Users can store a wider range of digital currencies, including ETH, Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Ripple (XRP).

Other functionalities of Trust Wallet include the ability to buy BTC, earn interest on stored funds, interact with the non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem, track crypto prices and act as a cryptocurrency exchange.

### How to Install and Use MetaMask
To start using the wallet, you need to install the correct browser plugin. The setup process and usage are almost similar regardless of the browser you are using. 

MetaMask considers a strong password to have a minimum of eight characters including letters, numbers, and symbols. Hit “Create,” and then write down the seed backup phrase, which contains 12 words.

It is recommended that you always write a seed phrase down and keep it somewhere safe from other parties. Also, it is highly advisable to never keep a digital copy of your backup phrase, also called a seed recovery. If anybody gains access to it, they can and will likely clean out your wallet by importing the seed to another wallet and gaining full access to your funds.

The backup phrase will be your only way to recover your wallet in the event that you forget your password, your device gets damaged, or if you want to open MetaMask on another device. Clicking the “Next” button takes you to the “secret Backup Phrase” confirmation page.

Here, you need to enter the phrase in precisely the same order it was presented. After which, hit “Confirm.” When logged out, click the MetaMask icon on your browser and use the login credentials to access the wallet again.

### What Are the MetaMask Fees?
MetaMask provides a default gas fee for every transaction, depending on the status of the Ethereum network. In addition, users are given the option to alter the gas fees and gas limits through an advanced tab that allows parameter customization.

The difference between fees and limits is that fees are the cost of processing transactions, while gas limits are the highest transaction costs a user is willing to bet on a single transaction.

Note that transaction fees determine the transaction processing speed on the second-largest decentralized blockchain. The higher the prices, the faster the confirmation time and vice versa. MetaMask divides gas fee options into “Fastest, Fast, and Slow.”
