## Drawbacks and risks
* It is not meant to be sustainable. It is a limited time opportunity.
* The more people that stake their tokens for liquidity, the lower the APY becomes
* Permission fees, gas fees, fees to purchase, withdrawing fees will all eat on the returns
* On most platforms APYs are recalculated every 24 hrs.
* Smart contract bugs
* Loopholes
* Rug-pulls
* Liquidation (if the platform uses borrowing and lending strategies)
* Price drops
* Stable coins losing their pegs
* [[Impermanent loss]]


## Questions to ask
* Who is incentivized to give that interest rate?
* How long does it last?
* On what network does it make sense to farm taking into consideration the fees?
*
