# Performance Fee Calculation Methodologies
Although there are a wide variety of performance fee calculation methodologies in the market, they can generally be characterised into three broad types.

### Whole of fund
The simplest performance fee methodology is the whole of fund method. This involves determining the performance of the fund (or class) as a whole and calculating the performance fee accordingly.

The whole of fund method can be used effectively for closed-end funds where there is only one issue of shares or units and no (or infrequent) redemptions of shares or units. However, where there are multiple issues or redemptions of shares or units, the whole of fund method may produce unfair results for investors or fund managers.

### Series
An alternative for funds with multiple issues or redemptions of shares or units is the series accounting method. This method uses different series of shares or units within each class. Each series will have the same rights attached to them but will have a different issue date and different net asset value. Accordingly, performance fees are calculated on a series by series basis.

The series accounting method is designed to overcome the inadequacies of the whole of fund method, however, this comes at a cost. As discussed, series accounting involves multiple series, all with different net asset values and performance fee calculations, leading to more complicated fund accounting and administration. To simplify this, at the end of a calculation period at which a performance fee is paid in respect of a series, that series may be 'rolled up' into the first series. Note that rolling up may have capital gains tax implications for investors.

Series accounting is relatively common in Australian hedge funds and Australian fund of hedge funds, where there are limited dealings in the fund. The series method is generally not suitable for funds that issue and redeem shares or units frequently (for example daily or weekly).

### Equalisation
An alternative to series accounting is the equalisation method. The equalisation method is different from series accounting because it uses only one series of units or shares in a class and performance fees are adjusted in respect of each individual investor. An equalisation credit or performance fee redemption is used to ensure that each investor pays the correct performance fee, that is, only in respect of performance from which they have benefited.

If an investor invests into the fund during a calculation period, as opposed to the beginning, when the net asset value is above the fund's high water mark, they would ordinarily pay too much in performance fee for the performance they have received. In such cases an equalisation credit will be paid by the new investor in addition to the subscription price.

The credit is commonly equal to the accrued performance fee of existing investors at the time of subscription by the new investor. The new investor is required to pay the equalisation credit to ensure that all investors have the same amount at risk per share or unit. At the end of a calculation period at which a performance fee is payable, the equalisation credit is 'cashed in' by applying the appropriate portion of the equalisation credit to acquire additional interests in the fund for the investor. This has the effect of cancelling out the excess performance fees paid by the investor. The remainder of any equalisation credit is carried over to the next calculation period until the credit has been fully applied.

If the investor invests into the fund when the net asset value is below the fund's high water mark the equalisation method employs a compulsory redemption of shares or units (paid to the manager as a performance fee) to ensure that the investor does not have a free ride' whilst maintaining a uniform net asset value across the class.

The equalisation method allows for fair treatment of investors while retaining a single net asset value per class of share or unit. The main disadvantages of this method include the complicated and non-transparent calculations that must be conducted for each investor.

The equalisation method is common in offshore hedge funds where there are limited dealings in the fund and limited numbers of investors. Like series accounting, the equalisation method is generally not suitable for funds that issue or redeem shares or units relatively frequently.

### Practical application
Given the difficulties involved with applying the series or equalisation methods, in many cases fund managers of open-ended daily dealing funds (those most commonly seen in the retail market) have opted to use the whole of fund method despite the potential inequities involved. The inequities can be partially avoided by accruing performance fees into daily unit prices. This limits the possibility of investors paying too much in performance fees, but may not prevent them enjoying a free ride. Despite this outcome, which can benefit investors at the expense of the manager, a cost versus benefit analysis undertaken by the manager often favours the whole of fund method.
