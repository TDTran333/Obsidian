# Financial Toolkit
## Module 1: Income, expenses and budget
Learnings:
-   how to decide what's really important when you spend money.
-   how to calculate income after deductions are taken off your paycheque.
-   how to track your expenses and reduce them if you need to.
-   how to prepare a realistic personal or family budget.
-   how to plan your finances to achieve your goals.

### 1.1 Needs and Wants
-   Needs are things that are essential for life. Wants are non-essential items that we would like to have.
-   It's important to differentiate between needs and wants and to balance them in your life.
-   Set spending priorities so you will have money for the things you really need and want.
-   Many factors influence how you spend, including emotions, habits and peer pressure. Watch how these different factors affect your spending decisions so you can get control of them.

### 1.2 Income
-   A job is the main source of income for most people, but there may be many other sources.
-   Deductions are taken off paycheques for taxes and to pay for social programs like pensions and employment insurance. The income that is left after deductions is called net income.
-   Prepare for a sudden loss of income by setting aside some cash every month for an emergency fund and by knowing where to turn for help

### 1.3 Expenses
-   Expenses may be fixed (stay the same every month) or variable (vary from month to month).
-   The first step in controlling your spending is to get in the habit of tracking your daily expenses so you know how much you spend and what you spend it on.
-   Reduce unnecessary spending by avoiding impulse buying, making easy lifestyle changes, and making your money go further with the products and services you buy.
-   Include debt repayment and savings as regular costs in your expense calculations.
-   When estimating your expenses, be sure to include irregular expenses (those that don't occur regularly) and to add a little extra for unexpected expenses.
-   Put money for unexpected expenses in a separate account so it is there when you need it.

### 1.4 How to budget
-   A budget is a comparison of income and expenses. It's an organized way to manage your money.
-   If you have more income than expenses at the end of the month, you have a surplus. The best things to do with a surplus are to repay debt (especially high-interest debt, like credit card debt) and increase your savings.
-   If you have more expenses than income, you have a deficit. You need to find ways to reduce your spending or increase your income.
-   An envelope system can be used to manage monthly spending as an alternative to a paper budget.
-   In an envelope system, you allocate money for different categories and then limit yourself to those amounts for the month.
-   Revisit your budgeting system at least monthly to keep it up to date and realistic. Compare your actual spending with your estimated spending, and adjust your budget as needed.

### 1.5 Budgeting to reach your goals
-   It's important to set short-, medium- and long-term financial goals.
-   Make sure your goals are SMART: **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**ealistic and **T**ime-Framed.
-   Break your financial goal into monthly pieces and add that amount to your budget. Adjust your spending in other areas if necessary to meet your monthly savings goal.

### 1.6 Action plan
