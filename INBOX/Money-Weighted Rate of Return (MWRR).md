# Money-Weighted Rate of Return (MWRR)

Starting in July 2016, dealers and portfolio advisors will be required to report investment performance to their clients.  The money-weighted rate of return (MWRR) was chosen by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) as the industry standard for these performance calculations.  Although the MWRR is arguably more relevant to the individual investor (as it can reward or penalize investors for the timing of their cash flows), it is considered by most advisors to be inadequate for benchmarking purposes.

As the MWRR assumes all cash flows receive the same rate of return while invested, its return can differ substantially from the time-weighted rate of return (TWRR) when large cash flows occur during periods of significantly fluctuating portfolio values.
