# How are bitcoin created?

At this point, nearly everyone has heard of bitcoin. But many folks still don’t quite understand how the currency is created.

It’s not printed like cash. It’s not a physical object like a gold bar. It’s not stored on a piece of plastic like a debit card. It just exists somewhere in a vast digital expanse until it’s excavated into circulation by a so-called bitcoin miner.

-   How bitcoin is created (a process called **mining**)
-   How the **economics** of mining have changed over time
-   The effects this process has on **power consumption**

Bitcoin shares a few similarities with gold:
-   **There’s a finite supply**: As dictated by bitcoin’s creator, there can only ever be **21m** total coins.
-   **They must be mined**: The only way to release new bitcoin into circulation is through the efforts of digital excavators.

### The digital miner
Nakamoto’s mission was to create a **decentralized** currency system that wasn’t beholden to middlemen. Among it’s touted benefits:
-   **It’s democratic**: Unlike paper money, where a single **central authority** like a bank manages a record of all transactions, bitcoin is minted, circulated, and audited by thousands of users. 
-   **It’s harder to manipulate**: Government agencies can’t intercede by doing things like increasing volume or fiddling with interest rates.
-   **It’s global**: Someone in Tennessee can instantaneously trade bitcoin with someone across the globe in Tokyo at a low cost.

The backbone of this concept is a _distributed_ network called the **blockchain**, where a record of all bitcoin transactions is stored.

This blockchain contains a public record of _all_ bitcoin transactions. Each time a trade is made through a cryptocurrency platform, the details of the transaction are [coded](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/SHA-256) and broadcast, along with other transactions, to a vast network of users called bitcoin miners.

From there, the following process unfolds:
1.  Miners compete to add the next block.
2.  Miners solve a computational problem (called “**proof of work**”) that assigns the block an identifying code (a **hash**).
3.  The “winning” block is distributed to, and verified by, all the other miners in the network and is added to the blockchain.

Only one block can be added at any given time, and each one takes **~10 minutes** on average to verify and attach.

These bitcoin miners serve 2 major functions:
1.  **They are the printing press of bitcoin**: Adding new blocks to the blockchain is the only way to release new bitcoin into circulation.
2.  **They are the auditors of bitcoin:** Through the process of mining, they verify the legitimacy of all transactions on the blockchain.

By solving the equation first and adding the next block to the chain, a miner is **rewarded** with a set amount of bitcoin.

When bitcoin mining first started, the reward was 50 bitcoin (BTC). But as dictated by the coin’s creator, the reward is cut in half every time 210k new blocks are added to the chain — or roughly every **4 years**.

As of February 2021, miners receive **6.25 bitcoin** for every new block they mine — or \~**\$294k** based on the current market value. They also get to keep the transaction fees from the trades in that block, which are currently around **\$20/trade**.

Today, it’s estimated that there are more than **1m bitcoin miners** in operation — and they’re all competing to add the next block to the chain.

Combined, the rewards these miners earn [top](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-mining-revenue-january-2021) **$1B per month**.

### The bitcoin mining arms race
A bitcoin miner has to solve a computational problem in order to successfully add a new block to the blockchain and receive his reward.

But in simple terms, a miner basically has to employ a computer to run through **trillions** of hexadecimal number combinations until it spits out an acceptable 64-character code. This coding keeps the blockchain secure.

The difficulty of this problem **adjusts in proportion** to the network’s total mining power: As more bitcoin miners join the network to compete, the problem becomes harder to solve, thus requiring even _more_ computing power.

The volume of miners on the network — and the random nature of number generation — has made winning a block reward into a **lottery**. Bitcoin miners have to weigh the cost of hardware (and more importantly, the cost of the **electricity** required to run it) against the slim odds of winning on a regular basis. In most cases, operating alone is no longer financially viable.

Today’s bitcoin mining scene is dominated by 2 factions:
-   **Mining pools**: Groups of individual miners who combine their computing power, then divide any rewards up proportionally, based on how much computing power each person contributed
-   **Massive mining “farms”** that have thousands of machines running 24/7

Around **66%** of the world’s bitcoin mining now happens in China, where cheap hardware makes large operations more economically feasible. In Dalian — China’s bitcoin mining capital — one factory alone mines **750 bitcoin** per month, or $35.6m in value at the current market rate. To do so, it utilizes 3k+ ASIC machines and spends $1m+ per month on electricity.

Averaging across all types of operations, one bitcoin [costs](https://www.thebalance.com/how-much-power-does-the-bitcoin-network-use-391280) **between $5k and $8.5k** to mine. Power makes up the vast majority of the overhead. But power consumption isn’t just an economic consideration, it’s one of the biggest controversies in the practice of bitcoin mining.

### The power problem
Collectively, bitcoin miners [use](https://cbeci.org/) **121.4 terawatt-hours** (tWh) of electricity per year to sustain their operations.

To give that number some additional context, that’s enough to power the **entire population of Argentina** (45m) for an entire year.
