# How to Read Financial News: Tips from Portfolio Managers

* Most research is backward-looking rather than predictive. Reading obscure financial information may look and feel like productive work, but most of this content has little chance of leading to better results.
* After all, reading is easier than critical thinking, and it may impress people if you are up to date on a wide range of financial subjects.
* Rather than reading less, portfolio managers must learn to rapidly detect what is nonsense and move on.

### Three Questions to Ask
-   Is the article based on data or opinion?
-   Is it descriptive of past conditions or predictive of the future?
-   Does the article have a testable hypothesis?

### Best Practices
* **Understand the Consensus**: You need to grasp the conventional wisdom in order to bet against it. This becomes easier once you’ve done the groundwork on a specific investment thesis.
* **Seek Disagreement:** You need to understand the other side of the trade. This means reading opinions that contrast with yours in order to avoid confirmation bias.
* **Question the Narrative:** “Reading too much financial news is counterproductive. The narratives are often incomplete, misleading, or flat out wrong.”
* **Respect the Data:** Always check the primary source when possible.
* **Avoid Partisan Interpretation:**
* **Develop Your Own Framework:** Before you read the news, you must have your own framework in place for decision-making. Otherwise, you’ll be unduly influenced by what you read. “You must have an independent view of the markets or the media will force a view upon you.”

### Tips for White Papers
When reading long reports and academic research, reviewing multiple articles on the same topic is better than random reading. To do this, sort content by topic, save papers in folders, schedule weekly reading time when possible, and read in batches.

### Dealing with Politics
Effective interpretation must be nonpartisan but does not ignore politics. In fact, some portfolio managers use political interpretation as an edge. Gerstein believes that politics can be a leading indicator because it reflects the mood of the country.
