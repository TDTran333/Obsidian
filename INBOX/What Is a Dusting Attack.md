# What Is a Dusting Attack?
A dusting attack refers to a relatively new kind of malicious activity where hackers and scammers try and break the privacy of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency users by sending tiny amounts of coins to their wallets. The transactional activity of these wallets is then tracked down by the attackers, who perform a combined analysis of different addresses to deanonymize the person or company behind each wallet.

### Dusting attacks
Malicious actors realized that cryptocurrency users don't pay much attention to these tiny amounts showing up in their wallet addresses. So they began "dusting" a large number of addresses by sending a few satoshis to them (i.e., a small amount of LTC, BTC or other cryptocurrencies). After dusting different addresses, the next step of a dusting attack involves a combined analysis of those addresses in an attempt to identify which ones belong to the same crypto wallet.

The goal is to eventually link the dusted addresses and wallets to their respective companies or individuals. If successful, the attackers may use this knowledge against their targets, either through elaborated phishing attacks or cyber-extortion threats.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions are more likely to remain anonymous because they are performed without the involvement of any intermediary. However, many crypto exchanges collect personal data through KYC verification processes, meaning that when users move funds between their personal wallets and exchange accounts, they are taking the risk of being somehow deanonymized.

It's important to keep in mind that, unlike many tend to believe, Bitcoin is not really an anonymous cryptocurrency. Besides the recently created dusting attacks, there are many companies, research labs, and governmental agencies performing blockchain analyses in an attempt to deanonymize blockchain networks â€“ and some argue they already made significant progress.

### Closing thoughts
When you hold cryptocurrencies in a personal wallet, you are acting as your own bank. There is nothing you can do if your wallet gets hacked or your lose your private keys.

Privacy and security are getting more and more valuable every day, not only for the ones that have something to hide but for all of us. And those are particularly valuable for cryptocurrency traders and investors.

Along with dusting and other deanonymizing attacks, it's also important to be wary of the other security threats that are part of the cryptocurrency space, such as Cryptojacking, Ransomware, and Phishing. Additional security measures may include installing a VPN along with a trustworthy antivirus in all of your devices, encrypting your wallets, and storing your keys inside encrypted folders.
