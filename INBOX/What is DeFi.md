# What is DeFi
To understand DeFi we first need to break out and define its two morphemes: “decentralized” and “finance.”

The “Fi” in DeFi includes:
-   Trading—the exchange of one asset for another;
-   Lending & Borrowing—the borrowing or lending of an asset for interest;
-   Derivatives—asset whose value is derived on the value of other asset(s);
-   Prediction Markets—trading on the outcome of events; and
-   Insurance—event-driven compensation in return for a premium.

The key potential that we have with DeFi is an alternative financial system that is open to both access and innovation.
