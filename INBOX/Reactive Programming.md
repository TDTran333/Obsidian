# Reactive Programming
### Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams.
### On top of that, you are given an amazing toolbox of functions to combine, create and filter any of those streams.

A stream is a sequence of ongoing events ordered in time. It can emit three different things: a value (of some type), an error, or a "completed" signal. Consider that the "completed" takes place, for instance, when the current window or view containing that button is closed.
