# Singular value decomposition
Singular value decomposition (SVD) is one of the most widely used algorithms for data processing, reduced-order modeling, and high-dimensional statistics.  
 
 It is the data-driven generalization of a [[Fourier Transform]].
 
 ### Use of SVD
* Solve Ax = b for non square A 
* linear regression model
* basis PCA
* correlation
