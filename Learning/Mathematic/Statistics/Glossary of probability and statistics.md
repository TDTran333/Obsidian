Most of the terms listed in Wikipedia glossaries are already defined and explained within Wikipedia itself. However, glossaries like this one are useful for looking up, comparing and reviewing large numbers of terms together. You can help enhance this page by adding new terms or writing definitions for existing ones.

The following is a [glossary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary "Glossary") of terms used in the [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") sciences [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") and probability.

In a statistical study, concomitants are any variables whose values are unaffected by treatments, such as a unit’s age, gender, and cholesterol level before starting a diet (treatment).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_probability_and_statistics#cite_note-Reiter-1)

[conditional distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_distribution "Conditional distribution")

Given two jointly distributed random variables _X_ and _Y_, the conditional probability distribution of _Y_ given _X_ (written "_Y_ | _X_") is the probability distribution of _Y_ when _X_ is known to be a particular value

[conditional probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability "Conditional probability")

The probability of some event A, assuming event B. Conditional probability is written P(_A_|_B_), and is read "the probability of _A_, given _B_"[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_probability_and_statistics#cite_note-probstatsymbols-2)

[conditional probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability_distribution "Conditional probability distribution")

[confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval "Confidence interval")

In inferential statistics, a CI is a range of plausible values for some parameter, such as the population mean.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_probability_and_statistics#cite_note-Kalinowski-3) For example, based on a study of sleep habits among 100 people, a researcher may estimate that the overall population sleeps somewhere between 5 and 9 hours per night. This is different from the sample mean, which can be measured directly.

confidence level

Also known as a confidence coefficient, the confidence level indicates the probability that the confidence interval (range) captures the true population mean. For example, a confidence interval with a 95 percent confidence level has a 95 percent chance of capturing the population mean. Technically, this means that, if the experiment were repeated many times, 95 percent of the CIs would contain the true population mean.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_probability_and_statistics#cite_note-Kalinowski-3)

[correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation "Correlation")

Also called correlation coefficient, a numeric measure of the strength of linear relationship between two random variables (one can use it to quantify, for example, how shoe size and height are correlated in the population). An example is the [Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient "Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient"), which is found by dividing the covariance of the two variables by the product of their standard deviations. Independent variables have a correlation of 0. A population correlation is often represented by the symbol ![\rho ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f7d439671d1289b6a816e6af7a304be40608d64), while a sample correlation by ![r](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_probability_and_statistics#cite_note-probstatsymbols-2)

[sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_sample "Statistical sample")

That part of a population which is actually observed

[Sample mean and covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_mean_and_covariance "Sample mean and covariance")

The arithmetic mean of a sample of values drawn from the population. It is denoted by ![{\overline {x}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9fa4039bbc2a0048c3a3c02e5fd24390cab0dc97).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_probability_and_statistics#cite_note-probstatsymbols-2) An example is the average test score of a subset of 10 students from a class. Sample mean is used as an estimator of the population mean, which in this example would be the average test score of all of the students in the class.

[sample space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_space "Sample space")

The set of possible outcomes of an experiment. For example, the sample space for rolling a six-sided die will be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

[skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness "Skewness")

A measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. Roughly speaking, a distribution has positive skew (right-skewed) if the higher tail is longer and negative skew (left-skewed) if the lower tail is longer (confusing the two is a common error)

[spectrum bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_bias "Spectrum bias")

[standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation "Standard deviation")

The most commonly used measure of statistical dispersion. It is the [square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root "Square root") of the variance, and is generally written ![\sigma ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/59f59b7c3e6fdb1d0365a494b81fb9a696138c36) ([sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_(letter) "Sigma (letter)"))[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_probability_and_statistics#cite_note-probstatsymbols-2)

[statistical hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing "Statistical hypothesis testing")

[statistical independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_independence "Statistical independence")

Two events are independent if the outcome of one does not affect that of the other (for example, getting a 1 on one die roll does not affect the probability of getting a 1 on a second roll). Similarly, when we assert that two random variables are independent, we intuitively mean that knowing something about the value of one of them does not yield any information about the value of the other

[statistical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference "Statistical inference")

Inference about a population from a random sample drawn from it or, more generally, about a random process from its observed behavior during a finite period of time

[statistical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model "Statistical model")

[statistical population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population "Statistical population")

A set of entities about which statistical inferences are to be drawn, often based on random sampling. One can also talk about a population of measurements or values

[statistical dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion "Statistical dispersion")

Statistical variability is a measure of how diverse some data is. It can be expressed by the variance or the standard deviation

treatments

Variables in a statistical study that are conceptually manipulable. For example, in a health study, following a certain diet is a treatment whereas age is not.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_probability_and_statistics#cite_note-Reiter-1)

[trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment_(probability_theory) "Experiment (probability theory)")

Can refer to each individual repetition when talking about an experiment composed of any fixed number of them. As an example, one can think of an experiment being any number from one to _n_ coin tosses, say 17. In this case, one toss can be called a trial to avoid confusion, since the whole experiment is composed of 17 ones.
