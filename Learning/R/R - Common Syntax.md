# Common Syntax in R

---
Some of the basic syntax for R that’s used most often might include:

`#` — as in many other languages, `#` can be used to introduce a line of comments. This tells the compiler not to process the line, so it can be used to make code more readable by reminding future inspectors what blocks of code are intended to do.

`""` — quotes operate as one might expect; they denote a string data type in R.

`<-` — one of the quirks of R, the assignment operator is `<-` rather than the relatively more familiar use of `=`. 

`\` — the backslash, or reverse virgule, is the escape character in R. An escape character is used to “escape” (or ignore) the special meaning of certain characters in R and, instead, treat them literally.
