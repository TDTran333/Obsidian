# Notepad vs Laptop
Laptop are convenient for storing and retrieving notes, but can be distracting.
Notepad are conveninent for quickly mapping ideas, but hard to retrieve information later.

Typing notes on a laptop is more likely to result in transcribing lectures verbatim while taking paper notes are more likely to summarize and reframe the information in our own words according to Mueller and Oppheimer (2014).

They found there's an advantage to hand written notes for conceptual testing but no advantage to factual testing from processing the information. Afterward, they allowed the note-takers to review their notes and hand written notes performed better in both conceptual and factual testings. 

However, other research papers found the opposite results and laptop performed better on factual information recall than those who took notes by hand. 

Luo et al (2018) covered the previous studies and also found the following:
Note-taking results showed that laptop note takers recorded more notes (idea units and words) and more verbatim lecture strings than did longhand note takers who, in turn, recorded more visual notes (signals and images) than did laptop note takers.

Note-taking results showed that laptop note takers recorded more notes (idea units and words) and more verbatim lecture strings than did longhand note takers who, in turn, recorded more visual notes (signals and images) than did laptop note takers. Achievement results showed that when taking laptop notes, the process function of note taking was more beneficial than the product function of note taking (i.e., better image-related learning and similar text-related learning). When taking longhand notes, the product function of note taking was more beneficial than the process function of note taking (i.e., better text-related learning and similar image-related learning). Achievement findings suggest that the optimal note-taking medium depends on the nature of the lecture and whether notes are reviewed.
