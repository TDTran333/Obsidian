# Tim Ferriss's journaling and note-taking strategies
He has hypergraphia, a behavioral condition characterized by the intense desire to write or draw.

### The key is multiple passes
Selecting and distilling the absolute best ideas

#### Brainstorm notebook
For digesting information or brainstorming insight

Example of note taking and reviewing
Exercice to write and come up very quickly with all the things related to a particular topic or things you can do

##### Have a schedule for reviewing
Second pass say a week later, boxing and circling important ideas
A third pass later say a quarter with highlighting

#### Morning pages
For reducing anxiety or worry.

Put things that makes you anxious on paper in the morning so you can go on with your day.
It is intended to be unstructured, put it out there type of writing.

#### 5-minutes journal
For improving focus, execution and appreciation.

The advantage is it is simple.
Need to be concise and succinct.
Prompts, quotes, self reflection, feelings, how's the day, grateful for, how to make the day better.
