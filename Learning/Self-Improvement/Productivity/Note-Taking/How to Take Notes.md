# How to Take Notes

### Note-Taking Foundations
What's the purpose of taking notes?
Notes are a tool used to facilitate comprehension, memorization, and more effective future studying.

Note-taking requires two steps:
* The process function: Improve comprehension and retention during the lecture
* The product function: When we review the notes and commit them to memory

### [[Notepad vs Laptop]]
In summary, the effect of note-taking medium depended on whether students had an opportunity to review their notes before the assessment. When the students had the opportunity to review their notes, they generally performed better on the assessment if they took notes by hand than by a laptop. This was especially true on the visual component of the assessment. However, when they were not able to review their notes, the two methods of taking notes led to very similar performance.

Electronic devises note-taking can be enhanced if we use the tips below:

#### Eliminate Distractions
Failing to eliminate distraction drastically reduces the benefits of taking notes with an electronic devices.

#### Avoid Transcribing
Transcribing is a highly passive form of note-taking. Active learning is king. The priority is to understand the information. Put it into your own words.

#### Take Advantage of Images & Figures
Incorporating relevant images and figures make the information stick more.

#### Use a Tablet
Tablets allow the best of both. The convenience of digital notes with the ability to draw and annotate.

### Note Taking
How to approach note-taking effectively?

The first step is to take good notes:

#### The Cornell Method
Cornell notes follow a structure that facilitates active learning and recall. However, there are better way for active learning and recall.

#### The Outline Method
Start with a main topic or idea and next in subtopics with supporting points. Straightforward and simple way to organize the information. This is useful as we are only seeking to understand organize the information in this stage.

### Note Interacting & Reflecting
Once the notes are taken, the key to learning the information isn't to brute force it by re-reading the notes. Rather, you need to understand whether the material is fact-heavy or concept-heavy and determine the appropriate forms of active learning.

With fact-heavy materials, there is an immense amount of information that needs to be memorized but understanding them isn't that difficult. Flashcards are a good tools.
With concept-heavy materials, the difficulty lies in understanding and applying the concepts. Making summary sheets will help.

Most subjects have a mix of facts to memorize and difficult concepts to understand but one aspect will tend to be more dominant.

####  Flashcards
For fact-heavy subjects, flashcards are great. Good quality flashcards are hard to make and  should be made after organizing the information, have a good understanding of it,  connected, and simplified the notes. Flashcard are used to drill information that requires rote memorization more than conceptual understanding.

####  Summary Sheets
For approach concept-heavy subjects, summary sheets are ideal. They are condensed notes of your notes. Essentially, you are synthesizing your notes and trimming the fat into something more manageable. Make connections between the ideas and try to view them in new ways such as table or other visuals. Actively seek to understand, make connections and simplify.

There are other methods but they'll be covered in another note.
