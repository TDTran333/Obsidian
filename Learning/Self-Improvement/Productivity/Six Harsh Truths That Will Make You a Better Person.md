 - The World Only Cares About What It Can Get from You
 -  The difference in those two attitudes -- bitter vs. motivated -- largely determines whether or not you'll succeed in the world
 -  But make no mistake: Your "job" -- the useful thing you do for other people -- is all you are.
 -  What You Produce Does Not Have to Make Money, But It Does Have to Benefit People
 -   I'm asking *what do you offer*? Are you smart? Funny? Interesting? Talented? Ambitious? Creative? OK, now *what do you do* to demonstrate those attributes to the world? 
 -   You Hate Yourself Because You Don't Do Anything
 -   It's always "How can I get a job?" and not "How can I become the type of person employers want?" It's "How can I get pretty girls to like me?" instead of "How can I become the type of person that pretty girls like?"
 -   Do the math: How much of your time is spent consuming things other people made (TV, music, video games, websites) versus making your own? Only one of those adds to your value as a human being.
 -   What You Are Inside Only Matters Because of What It Makes You Do
 -   Everything Inside You Will Fight Improvement
 -   Remember, misery is comfortable. It's why so many people prefer it. Happiness takes effort.
