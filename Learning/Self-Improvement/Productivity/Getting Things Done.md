# Getting Things Done
Getting Things Done (GTD) is a life-work management system designed and authored by David Allen. Essentially, GTD is centred around the following flow:

### 1. Capturing your ideas and tasks.
Capturing is about gathering everything together and getting the ideas or tasks from your head and into your chosen medium straight away. 

### 2. Clarifying them.
Is it actionable? Do you need to do something about it? 
Will it take 2 minutes or less to complete? 
What needs to be done to complete the task/idea?

### 3. Organising them.
Organize into **Project, Time and Context.**

### 4. Reflecting on them.
Weekly review is a “Critical factor for success.” 

### 5. Engaging with them.
Having the structures in place gets rid of the constant firefighting or organisational anxiety. The hard planning work is done. Just do it.
