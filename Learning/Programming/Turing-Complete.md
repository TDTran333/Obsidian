# Turing-Complete
In computability theory, a system of data-manipulation rules is said to be Turing-complete or computationally universal if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine. This means that this system is able to recognize or decide other data-manipulation rule sets. Turing completeness is used as a way to express the power of such a data-manipulation rule set. Virtually all programming languages today are Turing-complete. The concept is named after English mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing.

In other words...

Alan Turing created a theoretical model that is essentially the simplest thing capable of being a computer. He stripped away all the details, leaving a Turing machine, which takes input, does computations on it, and produces output. The advantage of his machine is that it can more easily be analyzed mathematically, letting us definitively prove what computers can or cannot do.

If a computer or programming language can be shown to have all the capabilities of a Turing machine, it is said to be Turing complete.
