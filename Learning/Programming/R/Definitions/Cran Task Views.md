### CRAN Task View: Statistics for the Social Sciences
#### Description of Other Relevant Task Views:
-   [Bayesian](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html): Methods of Bayesian inference in a variety of settings of interest to social scientists, including mixed-effects models.
-   [Econometrics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Econometrics.html) and [Finance](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Finance.html): In addition to methods of specific interest to economists and financial analysts, these task views covers a variety of commonly used regression models and methods, instrumental-variables estimation, models for panel data, and some time-series models.
-   [MetaAnalysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MetaAnalysis.html): Methods of meta analysis for combining results from primary studies. If data on individuals in each study are available, meta analysis can be performed using [mixed-effects models](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/SocialSciences.html#mixed-models) .
-   [Multivariate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Multivariate.html): A broad, if far from exhaustive, catalog of methods implemented in R for analyzing multivariate data, from data visualization to statistical modeling, and including correspondence analysis for multivariate categorical data.
-   [OfficialStatistics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/OfficialStatistics.html): Covers not only official statistics but also methods for collecting and analyzing data from complex sample surveys, such as the [survey](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survey/index.html) package.
-   [Psychometrics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Psychometrics.html): Extensively covers methods of scale construction, including item-response theory, multidimensional scaling, and classical test theory, along with other topics of interest in the social sciences, such as structural-equation modeling.
-   [Spatial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html): Methods for managing, visualizing, and modeling spatial data, including spatial regression analysis.
-   [SpatioTemporal](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/SpatioTemporal.html): Methods for representing, visualizing, and analyzing data with information both on time and location.
-   [Survival](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Survival.html): Methods for survival analysis (often termed "event-history analysis" in the social sciences), beyond the basic and standard methods, such as for Cox regression, included in the recommended [survival](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html) package.
-   [TimeSeries](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html): Methods for representing, manipulating, visualizing, and modeling time-series data, including time-series regression methods.
