# RMarkdown
In a nutshell, R Markdown stands on the shoulders of knitr and Pandoc. The former executes the computer code embedded in Markdown, and converts R Markdown to Markdown. The latter renders Markdown to the output format you want (such as PDF, HTML, Word, and so on).

 At this point, there are a large number of tasks that you could do with R Markdown:

 * Compile a single R Markdown document to a report in different formats, such as PDF, HTML, or Word.
 * Create notebooks in which you can directly run code chunks interactively.
 * Make slides for presentations (HTML5, LaTeX Beamer, or PowerPoint).
 * Produce dashboards with flexible, interactive, and attractive layouts.
 * Build interactive applications based on Shiny.
 * Write journal articles.
 * Author books of multiple chapters.
 * Generate websites and blogs.
