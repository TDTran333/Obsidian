##### I()
Change the class of an object to indicate that it should be treated ‘as is’.

##### diff()
Returns suitably lagged and iterated differences.
[[I() in R formula]]

##### paste(), paste0()
Concatenate vectors after converting to character.

The difference between paste() and paste0() is that the argument sep by default is ” ” (paste) and “” (paste0). In conclusion, paste0() is faster than paste() if our objective is concatenate strings without spaces because we don't have to specify the argument sep
