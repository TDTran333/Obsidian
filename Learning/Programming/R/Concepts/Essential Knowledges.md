### 1. What is R?

This should be an easy one for data science job applicants. R is an open-source language and environment for statistical computing and analysis.

### 2. What are some advantages of R?

**Its open-source nature.** This qualifies as both an advantage and disadvantage for various reasons, but being open source means it’s widely accessible, free to use, and extensible.

**Its package ecosystem.** The built-in functionality available via R packages means you don’t have to spend a ton of time reinventing the wheel as a data scientist.

**Its graphical and statistical aptitude.** By many people’s accounts, R’s graphing capabilities are unmatched.

### 3. What are the disadvantages of R?

**Memory and performance.** In comparison to Python, R is often said to be the lesser language in terms of memory and performance. This is disputable, and many think it’s no longer relevant as 64-bit systems dominate the marketplace.

**Open source.** Being open source has its disadvantages as well as its advantages. For one, there’s no governing body managing R, so there’s no single source for support or quality control. This also means that sometimes the packages developed for R are not the highest quality.

**Security.** R was not built with security in mind, so it must rely on external resources to mind these gaps.

### 4. What are the similarities and differences between R and Python?

Attribute|Python|R|
:-|-|-|
Cost|★★★★★|★★★★★|
Security|★★★★☆|★☆☆☆☆|
Model building|★★★★★|★★★★★|
Learning curve|★★★☆☆|★★☆☆☆|
Visualization tools and libraries|★★★☆☆|★★★★★|

There are many comparisons to draw between Python and R. They are both free. They both have strong modeling capabilities. Python is generally considered more secure and easier to learn, but R is typically thought to have better visualization tools and libraries. In many jobs, you’ll be expected to use both R and Python, so it’s good to know about both, even if you aren’t fluent in both languages.

### 5. Why is R useful for data science?

R turns otherwise hours of graphically intensive jobs into minutes and keystrokes. In reality, you probably wouldn’t encounter the language of R outside the realm of data science or an adjacent field. It’s great for linear modeling, nonlinear modeling, time-series analysis, plotting, clustering, and so much more.

As a data manipulation and visualization tool, R can most definitely be used for predictive analytics. R as a whole provides numerous tools and packages for predictive modeling, so it’s the right tool for a data scientist.
