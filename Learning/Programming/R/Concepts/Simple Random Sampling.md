* Simple random sampling is not a reliable sampling method when the sample size is small. Because sample means vary a lot around the population mean, there's a good chance we'll get an unrepresentative sample.
* When we do simple random sampling, we should try to get a sample that is as large as possible. A large sample decreases the variability of the sampling process, which in turn decreases the chances that we'll get an unrepresentative sample.
