# Teaching the Tidyverse to beginners
### How to teach R?
> Have **goals** for what you want the students to do, and start them doing as **early** as possible.
> &mdash; <cite>David Robinson</cite>

* Order matters
* When you teach something, show why it is useful

### Examples of program structure
* Goal: How to understand the data
	* Data wrangling
	* Data visualization
	* Grouping and summarizing
	* Types of visualizations

* Goal: Exploratory Data Analysis
	* Data cleaning and summarizing with dplyr
	* Data visualization with ggplot2
	* Tidy modeling with broom
	* Joining and tidying

### Why is the Tidyverse well suited for beginners?
* It is **powerful**, a few lines of code can generate alot of outputs
* It is **consistent**, all the pieces work together and according to a consistent philosophy

### What is left until later?
* Data Structures
* Loops
* Conditionals
* User-defined functions

### Where's to start?
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

### When shouldn't you teach the tidyverse first?
* If the goal is to learn to program or build R packages but why choose R?
	* R is used in one particular domain, understanding data and statistical analysis
* Another goal could be mathematical understanding
	* Teach matrices before data frames
	* Teach linear algebra before relational algebra (SQL)
	* Teach the abstract before the concrete
