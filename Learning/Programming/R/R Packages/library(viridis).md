Matplotlib 'viridis' and 'cividis' color map

This function creates a vector of n equally spaced colors along the Matplolib 'viridis' color map created by Stefan van der Walt and Nathaniel Smith. This color map is designed in such a way that it will analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when converted to black-and-white. It is also designed to be perceived by readers with the most common form of color blindness.
