### Git pull request
You make local code changes and then submit those changes to a remote project maintainer for review before those changes are implemented, or merged. This is called a pull request; you are requesting that someone reviews and approves your changes before they become final.

In other words:

When you send a pull request, you're asking (requesting) the official repo owner to pull some changes from your own repo. Hence "pull request".
