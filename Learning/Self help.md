SUCCESS
Optimism makes people perform better.
Most importantly, the optimism that
literally anything can be defeated with
enough effort. Every obstacle is merely
a challenge, not a threat. x 8
Habits are what form and deform your
life. Humans are short-sighted. Build a
ritual that will, much like compound
interest, build an amazing life.
Working out twice a day for a week
won’t do much. But a year could make
for a transformation. Failure is not one
dramatic fall, but a series of small
failures, compounded over a longer
period. X 5
Scale slowly. An overnight success still
had 1 step up goals every hour. A billion
dollar company once only had a goal of a
million dollars. Set numerous small,
achievable, bite sized goals - as opposed
to a few, huge chunky goals. X 4
Authenticity is king. People enjoy
authentic people, respect authentic
people and welcome authentic people. x
4
P A G E 2
Common sense beats all rules,
stipulations and otherwise. You likely
know most of what you learn, it’s simply
being reorganized to fit your mind
better. When it’s time to take action,
trust that you know what you’re doing
and focus solely on moving. x 3
Success comes from trying something,
failing and modifying the action -
Thousands of times. No amount of
preparation (beyond the basic) can
prepare you for the first day with
sharks. ACTION + MODIFICATION =
RESULTS x 3
Show small amounts of gratitude every
day. Make it apart of your ritual. The
gratitude forces you to focus on the
things you are happy about. Small
gratitude is low commitment and high
reward. X 2
Establish 3 to 20 second barriers
between bad habits. Take batteries out
the remote. Put junk food in trunk of
car. It won’t stop you completely. But it
will decrease significantly. Make
positive habits easier. Pack a healthy
lunch. X 2
OPTIMISM WINS
HABITS > WILLPOWER
SMALL, BITE SIZED GOALS
AUTHENTICITY WINS
AUTHENTICITY WINS
ACTION + MODIFICATION = WIN
SHOW GRATITUDE EVERY DAY
MAKE BAD HABITS DIFFICULT
SUCCESS P A G E 3
A huge part of succeeding at something
is simply showing up. Even if that means
you just walked in the door and back
out. If you show up, the math says you’ll
succeed, eventually. X 3
SHOW UP EVERY DAY
Go 150% + beyond what you are
expected to do. This is a 100% way to
gain immediate traction. Applied with
consistency can skyrocket results. x 2
GO ABOVE & BEYOND
Practice task isolation. The only thing
that matters in that moment is the task
at hand. Work on that task only until
you are ready to stop. Nothing else
matters until. X 2
ISOLATE YOUR TASKS
Constantly be evaluating yourself.
Every year, every month, week, day,
hour. - Do this 100% objectively and
healthily. The more you look at yourself
objectively and decide what you’re
doing right and wrong, the better
feedback you can use to improve. X 2
EVALUATE YOURSELF
If you are always the smartest person in
the room, you’re probably in a room full
of idiots or you’re lying to yourself.
SURROUND YOURSELF
WITH SMART PEOPLE
Double down on your strengths.
Neutralize your weaknesses. Make them
just capable enough to swim still water.
DOUBLE DOWN ON STRENGTHS
Adaptation is the key to survival. You
cannot run over a jungle, but with the
right small, frequent adjustments, you
can run through a jungle.
ALWAYS BE ADAPTING
Discipline is not just following a plan
when you need a plan, but following the
plan when you’ve succeeded. Make a
plan and follow it, regardless of your
emotions.
FOLLOW A PLAN
Try fasting from a bad habit completely.
Replace it with something less bad.
Over time, you can replace a lot of small
bad habits with less bad habits and get
big change.
FAST FROM BAD HABITS
THEY CALL YOU CRAZY UNTIL IT WORKS. THEN THEY CALL IT GENIUS.
- FORREST GRIFFIN, UFC
SUCCESS P A G E 4
Organization, habits and the process of
planning is actually all simply tools to
clear space in your brain. You cannot
use a car efficiently if it is jammed to
the ceiling with clothes and furniture
that belong in your house. And the
furniture and clothes can’t be used
correctly either.
ORGANIZE YOUR MIND
“I’ve never seen any life transformation that didn’t begin with the person in question finally
getting tired of their own BS. "
- Elizabeth Gilbert
Take stock in the understanding that
90% of successful people are doing a lot
of hustle underneath the glam and
money. They wake up early, they skip
parties and they work - A LOT.
SUCCESS IS HUSTLE
Most habits can be changed by finding
the belief rooted to it and finding all the
evidence you can to break it. - “The gym
is a chore.” *Watch documentaries
about people who love the gym*
FIND THE ROOT
Tell no one your goals. Talking gives you
a rush of endorphins and dopamine. You
“dope yourself out” on talking and never
get anywhere.

dead. Love immensely and give your
friends and family what they deserve as
soon as possible and as often as
possible.
LOVE IMMENSELY
Chain together successful tasks and
create the illustration of commitment,
thus reducing your likelihood to miss
out. - Crossing off days on a calendar
chains a habit and thus reduces the
chance to break it.
CHAIN YOUR HABITS
Stage every commitment so you only
give what you get back, and scale it
slowly. Put in 1 cent, if it gives back 1
cent, then put in 5 cents. If it gives back
5 cents, continue. Never Give 100% to
an idea you haven’t tested at 10%, 25%,
50%, 75% etc.
INVEST SLOWLY
Never show your cards first in a
negotiation. The offer they have in mind
may be much higher than you’re
thinking.

to do things. So is the person who didn’t

have to like you is the best decision you
will ever make. People would have liked
