# How to Account for Performance Fees Properly

### What is Performance Fee?
A payment made to a fund manager for generating positive returns. The performance fee is generally calculated as a percentage of investment profits.

To measure investment return performance, the industry generally uses two concepts introduced here: **measurement period** and **the high-water mark (HWM)**. The measurement period is a periodic time, usually annual, but sometimes quarterly.

#### Mistake #1 “Payment of performance fee affects the price of the mutual unit”

In traditional mutual, hedge funds and ETFs, performance fee is taken in some fixed fiat currency with the direct withdrawal of money from the Fund without burning mutual units. Consequenly, the price per unit will decrease a little after each performance fee take.

Thus, investors will lose money, although they may not have any profit again. So how to act fairly?

Just keep balance between your units supply and your TPV in order not to affect the unit price. We should burn units along with money withdrawal from the Fund or make a direct transfer of units from an investor to the manager without money withdrawal from the Fund.

### Does that really work??? something seems wrong here

#### Mistake #2 “Calculate performance fee by one total HWM for all investors”
Each investor bought units by different price individually in his own time. We should keep the individual value of HWM for each investor and take performance fee individually.

#### Mistake #3 “Missing performance fee before each withdrawal”
The investor has an incentive to withdraw money before performance fee event. You Fund will miss out its honestly earned money. What to do?

You should take personal performance fee automatically before each withdrawal of particular investor.

#### Mistake #4 “Don’t change HWM after additional deposits”
We always should calculate the weighted average purchase price per share after the investor’s deposit.
