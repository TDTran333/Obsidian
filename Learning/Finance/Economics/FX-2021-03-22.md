* **The Federal Reserve (Fed)** opted to keep its **pessimistic tone** last week. The bond market has its doubts and **10-year yields continue to climb (1.70%)**
* **Canada**: **January Retail Sales fell by 1.1% but remain above pre-pandemic levels** and much better than analysts’ expectations (-3.0%) despite a context with many restrictive measures. **Consumers have shifted to online shopping**. February and March should produce better numbers
* **TRY**: The symbol for **Turkey’s currency**, which has **lost more than 10% since Sunday** after the governor of the **country’s central bank was dismissed after raising interest rates to counter 15% inflation**. This kind of movement for a currency is exceptional. 
* **Conclusion**: In a Canadian economy that is holding up well, the **CAD should remain strong in 2021**. However, doubts concerning the Fed’s pessimism could result in a rally in the USD that exporters should be prepared to seize on. What’s more, the third wave of COVID-19 and vaccination gaffes in many European countries could provide **temporary strength to the USD** as the United States continues to impress every day with their vaccination logistics
