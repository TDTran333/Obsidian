# What Is a Neobank?
Neobanks are online-only financial institutions that are similar to banks. The offerings of a neobank are usually limited compared to traditional banks—sometimes no more than a simple checking and savings account. The slimmed-down model often allows neobank customers to enjoy fewer fees and higher-than-average interest rates.

## How Neobanks Work
From a customer’s perspective, a neobank might amount to nothing more than an app you use to manage your money and make decisions. For those who are comfortable with technology, neobank accounts are easy to quickly set up. You can often establish a relationship with a neobank and start using its services without signing any physical paperwork; just sign up for an account and download the app.
