### Program Overview

To this effect, and as part of the PL Program, we recommend that members complete a minimum of 20 hours of Professional Learning activities, including a minimum of 2 hours in the content areas of Standards, Ethics, and  Regulations  (SER),  each  member  year. 

### Criteria
PL credit can be earned through a variety of self-study activities (e.g., reading books and journal articles) or by participating in CFA   Institute, CFA   Society,   or   third-party   live   offerings.   Essentially,   members  use  the  principles-based  criteria,  outlined  here,  to  determine  eligibility  for  any PLactivity:
* The  activity  should  be  educational  in  nature  and  geared  toward  increasing  theknowledge, skills, and abilities of an *investment professional*.
* The educational content should relate to one or more topics derived from the CFAInstitute Global Body of Investment Knowledge (GBIKÂ®). Topical areas may be found on our [website](https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/collection)

### CALCULATING CREDIT
* One PL credit hour is equal to one hour (60 minutes) of educational activity.
* Credits  should  be  rounded  to  the  nearest  quarter-hour,  and  0.25  is  the  minimum  credit amount that can be assigned to any program or activity.
* SER is a subgroup of the total number of assigned PL credit hours and is calculated in the same manner as PL credit hours.
* As  a  general  rule,  no  single  self-study  activity  may  earn  greater  than  20  PL  credit  hours (e.g., reading a single textbook should qualify for no more than 20 PL credits).

### TRACKING ACTIVITIES
You are not required to keep a record of the continuing professional development activi-ties you complete as part of the PL Program, but should you choose to do so, we provide the [online  tracking  tool](https://cpd.cfainstitute.org/)  as  a  resource.
