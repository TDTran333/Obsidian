# Management Expense Ratio (MER)

The Management Expense Ratio (**MER**) represents the combined total of the management fee, operating expenses and taxes charged to a fund during a given year expressed as a percentage of a fund's average net assets for that year. All mutual funds have an **MER**.

A reasonable expense ratio for an actively managed portfolio is about 0.5% to 0.75%, while an expense ratio greater than 1.5% is typically considered high these days. For passive or index funds, the typical ratio is about 0.2% but can be as low as 0.02% or less in some cases.
