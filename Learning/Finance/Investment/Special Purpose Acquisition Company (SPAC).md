# Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC)

A special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) is a company with no commercial operations that is formed strictly to raise capital through an [initial public offering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) ([IPO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp)) for the purpose of acquiring an existing company. Also known as "[blank check companies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blankcheckcompany.asp)," SPACs have been around for decades. In recent years, they've become more popular, attracting big-name underwriters and investors and raising a record amount of IPO money.
