# How to Read Financial News: Tips from Portfolio Managers

* Most research is backward-looking rather than predictive. Reading obscure financial information may look and feel like productive work, but most of this content has little chance of leading to better results.
* After all, reading is easier than critical thinking, and it may impress people if you are up to date on a wide range of financial subjects.
* Rather than reading less, portfolio managers must learn to rapidly detect what is nonsense and move on.

### Three Questions to Ask
-   Is the article based on data or opinion?
-   Is it descriptive of past conditions or predictive of the future?
-   Does the article have a testable hypothesis?

### Best Practices
* **Understand the Consensus**: You need to grasp the conventional wisdom in order to bet against it. This becomes easier once you’ve done the groundwork on a specific investment thesis.
* **Seek Disagreement:** You need to understand the other side of the trade. This means reading opinions that contrast with yours in order to avoid confirmation bias.
* **Question the Narrative:** “Reading too much financial news is counterproductive. The narratives are often incomplete, misleading, or flat out wrong.”
* **Respect the Data:** Always check the primary source when possible.
* **Avoid Partisan Interpretation:**
* **Develop Your Own Framework:** Before you read the news, you must have your own framework in place for decision-making. Otherwise, you’ll be unduly influenced by what you read. “You must have an independent view of the markets or the media will force a view upon you.”

### Tips for White Papers
When reading long reports and academic research, reviewing multiple articles on the same topic is better than random reading. To do this, sort content by topic, save papers in folders, schedule weekly reading time when possible, and read in batches.

### Dealing with Politics
Effective interpretation must be nonpartisan but does not ignore politics. In fact, some portfolio managers use political interpretation as an edge. Gerstein believes that politics can be a leading indicator because it reflects the mood of the country.

### Process Determines Priorities
The action comes first, and the narrative comes later — if it comes at all.

### Narratives Follow Prices
* The narrative follows prices because readers want a story.
* Stock prices already reflected expectations and market prices absorbed news faster than you can trade
* Current trends affected current analysis (including short-term estimates and long-term projections), so reading more research does not necessarily help make better decisions.
* News is descriptive in nature, not predictive, and this makes all the difference.
* Market prices reflect investor expectations and conventional wisdom, so you want to know: Are consensus expectations reasonable? Optimistic? Pessimistic?

### Our Process Determines Our Priorities
Time is limited, and top priorities should be asset allocation and risk management.

### Simple Rules for Decision Making
* **Trust algorithms, not people:** Use simple rules rather than personal discretion. It is a perennial temptation to tweak the process, but this does not add value.
* **Take the broad view:** Frame the investment process as broadly as possible.
* **Test for regret:** Clients who are prone to regret tend to bail out at the bottom of the market, so assess their risk tolerance for any strategy, and put this in the context of the client’s wealth, income, goals, and personality.
* **Seek advice from people we trust:** Our cognitive biases create blind spots, so I stress test my ideas with colleagues. Find people with integrity and learn to harness the power of their insight and criticism.

### A Framework for Reading Financial News
#### Understanding Consensus
Narratives follow prices because readers want an explanation, and a consensus eventually emerges. This consensus forms a narrative, and the consensus is also embedded in market prices. Since investors look to the future, market prices imply a set of assumptions and probabilities about what will happen. These assumptions may be optimistic or pessimistic, and these assumptions may be coherent or incoherent. Either way, consensus expectations are a logical starting point for putting any financial news in the proper context.

#### The Usual Suspects
Consult a variety of media, both financial and otherwise, to inform your understanding of the markets and the economy.

#### Analyze the Frequency and Framing of Stories
What drives the interpretation of financial news? How is consensus formed?
The frequency of stories and the framing of narratives around them have an enormous impact on how we perceive and interpret the news and how we survey the investment landscape. As investors, we must develop a systematic framework — a set of filters — to address this issue.

**1\. Story Selection**
Journalists typically define “newsworthiness” based on such factors as a story’s impact, timeliness, novelty, controversy, human interest, and proximity to the audience.
**2\. Story Frequency**
The frequency of a news story _does_ influence public opinion and investor sentiment.
**3\. Framing**
* Conservative vs. Liberal
* Optimistic vs. Pessimistic
	* People are systematically pessimistic about global trends, according to Hans Rosling in Factfulness. This pessimism suggests that investors are underestimating the health of the global economy.
* Short Term vs. Long Term
* Reported Results vs. Investor Expectations
* Pro-Business vs. Anti-Business
* Pro-Government vs. Anti-Government

#### Separate the Narrative from the Noise
Often the consensus is correct and the market narrative reliably explains price action. However, old narratives cast a long shadow and may obscure the truth.

When you don’t understand why prices are moving, it pays to remember a particular aphorism: Maybe someone knows something you don’t.

When it’s impossible to separate the narrative from the noise, you might be best served by just liquidating your position.

* **Filters**
* **Ask Open-Ended Questions**
* **Go Deep**
“There are investors who are smarter than you, have better tools than you, and who work harder than you. How will you compete with them?” 
Conduct open-ended research because it will add more value than studying daily news and daily price movements. You do not have an informational advantage in trading, so expect to be the sucker at the table. Be humble about your investment process and to focus on risk management in your positions and portfolios.

* **Concentrate**
	* **Reduce interruptions:** Read long-form material early in the morning or at scheduled times during business hours.
	* **Use a time tracker:** Target pomodoros and deep flow
	* **Use white noise or music**

* **Prevent Memory Contamination**
This is what happens when we remember facts but can’t remember where we learned them.

###### Memory Contamination
“Our memories are not an accurate recording of the past. They are constructed from imperfect perception filtered through our beliefs and biases, and then over time they morph and merge. Our memories serve more to support our beliefs rather than inform them.”

And if our memories are contaminated, so are the rules of thumb we use to make investment decisions.

**Tabloid Journalism**
1.  Simplify
2.  Exaggerate
3.  Add fear

**How to Reduce Memory Contamination**
There is no easy way to develop a deep understanding of a topic. In-depth research requires that we consider a variety of perspectives. One way to reduce the risk of memory contamination is to inform ourselves with facts before exposing ourselves to the tabloid version. When we have a fully informed opinion and a broad understanding, sensational headlines have less of an emotional impact.

1.  Start with the facts.
2.  Form your own opinion.
3.  Check other sources that you know are reliable (in case you missed something).
4.  Then you can be safely exposed to tabloid news without fear of contamination.

Investment knowledge is not enough: You must change your investment process and your reading habits to mitigate your behavioral biases.

“Which Challenges Do You Face Most Often in Your Professional Life?”
The overwhelming majority of poll respondents cited information overload.

1.  Understand what clients need.
2.  Develop a simple investment process.
3.  Design your reading priorities accordingly.
4.  Build relationships with people you trust.
5.  Be accountable for mistakes.
