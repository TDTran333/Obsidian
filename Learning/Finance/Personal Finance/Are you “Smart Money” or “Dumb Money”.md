# Are you “Smart Money” or “Dumb Money”?
What is “dumb money”? It is investors that invest when the markets are high and then sell when the markets are low.

This is the natural way that investors with a human gut tend to invest. The human gut tends to make investors momentum investors. They feel more confident after the market is up and more scared after it has fallen.

In addition, “herding” means investors are more confident if they are doing what they think most other investors are doing. “Let’s all sell at the bottom together.”

How significant is this? According to Dalbar, the average investor lost 58% of their return each year over the last 20 years by buying high and selling low. Note that is the average of all investors.

What can you do to join the “smart money”? Here are a couple simple solutions:

-   Become a buy and hold investor. Don’t try to time the market. Choose your investment mix of quality investments and stick with it. It sounds boring, but it works for Warren Buffett.
-   Ignore your gut. Professional investors usually have a discipline to help them ignore their gut. Your Stone Age human gut has been genetically designed to run in fearful situations and attack when we smell food, all of which is utterly useless for investing.
-   Never reduce your exposure to the stock market after a crash. That is the Big Mistake in investing. If the market falls by more than 20%, your exposure to the stock market must be as high or higher than it was before the fall.

With faith in your investments long term, patience, and discipline, you can join the “smart money”.
