# Tax Refund is NOT a Benefit of RRSPs
In short, the benefit to you of investing in your RRSP is tax-free growth of your investment, plus or minus a gain or loss on you tax brackets now vs. after you retire.

### The benefits of RRSPs
1.  Tax-free growth (same as the TFSA).
2.  Tax gain or loss depending on your post-retirement tax bracket when you withdraw vs. your tax bracket now when you contribute.

The tax refund itself is not a benefit. You have to pay it back plus interest (at the rate of return of your RRSP).
