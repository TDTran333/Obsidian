# Why It Would Be Ludicrous To Invest In These Model Portfolios
Before thinking of tilting the index portfolio and adding complexity, an investor should demonstrate the experience, competence, and discipline needed to execute the strategy. It means:
-   Having a large enough portfolio for this to even matter. 
-   Using an appropriate investing platform that allows you to hold USD, perform same-day currency conversions, and keep trading commissions low. 
-   Creating an investing spreadsheet that’s coded to tell you what to buy and when to rebalance.
-   Being an engineer or mathematician who not only loves to optimize but who also understands exactly what he or she is doing (and why).
-   Having the conviction to stick with this approach for the very long term, even through periods of underperformance.
-   Being humble enough to admit that you’re probably not going to execute this strategy perfectly.

Beginner investors shouldn’t worry about U.S. listed ETFs or factor tilts when they first start building their portfolio. It’s only once your portfolio gets into the $250,000 territory that you’ll start to see any meaningful savings in MER and foreign withholding taxes. Focus on your savings rate.
