# Why Don’t Most Financial Planners Plan Finances?

### Financial Plan
A financial plan, as defined by the FPSC, is a written document customized for you that gives you complete advice on all areas of your finances, including:

-   **Cash Flow**– Helping you understand how you spend your money.
-   **Debt/Asset Management** – Structuring your debts and your assets in the most effective way.
-   **Life Goals, including Retirement Plan** – Identify your financial goals in detail and strategies to help you achieve them.
-   **Income Tax Planning**– Determine most effective strategies to minimize tax over your lifetime.
-   **Estate Planning**– Determining the most effective way to transfer your assets to your beneficiaries.
-   **Risk Management**– Determine your needs for insurance and which type is the cheapest/most effective for you.
-   **Investment Management**– Recommending the strategies and investments appropriate for your plan and keeping you focused on your goals.

In short, it is a complete “road map” to the life you want that allows you to make decisions with your overall plan in mind, instead of making each decision on its own.

The main reason most Canadians will retire at a much lower standard of living than they want is because they never figured out how much they need to invest or what kind of strategies/investments they need to reach their goal.

### Why most financial planners don’t plan finances
1.  Blame the public – Financial planning is misunderstood by the public. Most people think short term and do not understand why they need a financial plan. Canadians do not ask that their advisor to do a comprehensive, written plan for them.
2.  Blame the schools – Financial education is not taught in schools, even though it is a basic life skill.
3.  Blame the industry organizations – They have not effectively educated the public on the need for a plan. They also have a confusing list of degrees, instead of focusing on the CFP designation.
4.  Blame “financial planners” – Most advisors focus on the investments or insurance that make them money and consider financial planning to be unpaid service work.
5.  Blame the banks, insurance companies and planning firms – They have not been able to figure out a good business model that includes financial planning.
6.  Blame the regulators – They focus regulation on products and disclosure related to products, and do not make allowances for advice that is part of a comprehensive plan.
7.  Blame the government – There are no national restrictions on who can call themselves a “financial planner” or “financial advisor”. Those that do not write professional financial plans and have the qualifications should have to call themselves what they are: “mutual fund salesperson” or “insurance rep”.
8.  Blame the industry –The industry has effectively taught the public that most “financial planners” are just salespeople. Most people have met with or know a “financial planner” and the planner did not do a plan, but mainly just tried to sell them a mutual fund or insurance.
