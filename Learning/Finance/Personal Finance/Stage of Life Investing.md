# Stage of Life Investing
### Stages of life with Lifecycle Investing
Essentially, you borrow in your first decade of investing and invest 100% in stocks. You slowly pay off the leverage by your early 50s. Then you start adding bonds, moving to your desired mix by retirement.

In practice, this process leads to 3 periods through your working life:

1.  High leverage period – Leverage 2:1 (or more) and invest 100% in stocks – no bonds. If you have $10,000 to invest, borrow an additional $10,000 (minimum) to invest each year. The maximum would be to borrow in year 1 the full $290,000 (for 75/25 allocation) or $390,000 (for a 100% equity allocation) to get you to $30,000 (or $400,000) in stocks. This period lasts until your stock market investments reach your target percentage of your lifetime amount invested (e.g. 75% of $400,000 = $300,000). Typically, this period is the first 10 years of your investing life.
2.  Reducing leverage period – Pay off investment loan slowly and maintain 100% in stocks. Typically eliminate leverage over 20 years by early 50s.
3.  No leverage period – Start introducing bonds moving to your desired allocation (e.g. 75% stocks/25% bonds) by the time you retire.

Lifecycle investing can be applied to either invest the same average amount as traditional “bit-by-bit” investing with less risk, or to have the same risk with more invested. The results are consistently better because you have more invested earlier. This is the benefit of diversifying across time.

### How do you implement Lifecycle Investing?
It is best to think of it as a concept. The Yale study showed that, when you are under age 50, the amount of money you have invested is far more important than your rate of return.

Options to implement Lifecycle Investing:
1.  **No leverage**: Focus your energy on financial planning concepts like how to save & invest more. Find creative ways to invest larger amounts in equities while you are young.
2.  **Investment loan**: Take one large loan or a series of small loans when you are young, based on the amount you are comfortable with and what you can qualify for. The most common types of investment loans are 100% loans and 3:1 loans. Most banks will only take mutual funds or seg funds as collateral, not ETFs or individual stocks.
3.  **Home equity**: Once you own a home, you can use a secured credit line to borrow to invest. Lifecycle Investing annually from your home equity might work similarly to the Smith Manoeuvre strategy.

If you want to implement Lifecycle Investing, it is best to create a Financial Plan first, to decide how to do it over your life. Don’t do it without a plan. 

### Summary
Essentially, you borrow in your first decade of investing and invest 100% in stocks. You slowly pay off the leverage by your early 50s. Then you start adding bonds, moving to your desired mix by retirement.

It has worked 100% of the time in the last 150 years and increased portfolios at retirement by an average of 63%. Results are so consistent because it reduces one of your biggest financial risks, “Last Decade Risk” by diversifying across time.

Lifecycle Investing is a practical example of how having a Financial Plan and using the right strategies are the most critical issues in having the future that you want.
