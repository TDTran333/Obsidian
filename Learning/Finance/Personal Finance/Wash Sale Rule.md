# Wash Sale Rule

The wash sale rule is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulation that prohibits someone from claiming a loss by selling and purchasing either the same or similar securities within 30 days of the sale at a loss. To comply with the rule, investors must wait at least 31 days before repurchasing the same investment.

In Canada, the wash-sale rule is known as the “[superficial loss rule](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-127-capital-gains/capital-losses-deductions/what-a-superficial-loss.html)” and it imposes the same 30-day blackout period before and after the sale of securities for investors who want to claim a loss.

“Here, with superficial losses, the denied loss is added to the security’s book value. Then, when the position is sold for good, the previously denied losses could be applied backwards using a [T1A (loss carryback) tax form](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-127-capital-gains/capital-losses-deductions/loss-carried-back-to-previous-years.html) to net out the prior-year tax liability.”
