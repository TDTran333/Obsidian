# Lessons learned from the virus crisis according to JPMorgan

**1. Volatility is normal: Markets reward investors who stick to their plans.**
The S&P 500 has suffered pullbacks of -10% or more in 22 of the past 40 years (with an overall average intra-year drop of more than -14%). Despite the usual dips (and sometimes dives), the index still managed to muster a positive return in 31 of the 40 years.

**2. Timing the market is risky business: Missing a few good days can undermine investment returns.**

**3. Optimism is not a weakness: Markets have a tendency to recover before the economy does.**
Asset performance doesn’t reflect whether things in the macro backdrop are “good” or bad,” it reflects whether investors think things are going to get “better” or “worse.” 

The takeaway? Markets are always focused on the future, and the future has a way of turning out better than the present. It typically pays to be an optimist and focus on the longer-term potential.
