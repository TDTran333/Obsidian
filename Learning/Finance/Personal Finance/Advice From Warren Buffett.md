# Advice From Warren Buffett

"The goal of a non-professional investor should not be to pick winners but should rather be to own a cross-section of business that in aggregate are bound to do well. A low cost index fund will achieve this goal."

"The investor who both diversifies and keep his cost minimal is certain to get satisfactory results. The unsophiscated investor who is realistic about his shortcomings is likely to obtain better long-term results than the knowledgeable professional who is blind to even a single weakness."
