# The Algebra of Wealth
Only half of millenials are earning more than their parents

### What is Rich?
Rich is having passive income greater than your burn. People on a path to money focus on their earnings; people on a path to wealth also focus on their burn. It’s not your income, but your income-to-expense ratio, that determines if you’re rich.

``` Focus x Stoicism x Time x Diversification = WEALTH ```

**Focus** on what matters. Be a **Stoic** in the face of temptation. Use **Time** to your advantage. **Diversify** your investments.

#### Focus
People conflate a lack of focus with a lack of talent. Intelligence and talent are correlated with success, but the strongest signal of future success is your perseverance and resilience. Your "grit".

Unless you are supremely disciplined, your career will have to be something that gives you some enjoyment, but don’t mistake focus for your “passion.” People who tell you to follow your passion are already rich: Follow your talent.

Focus on putting yourself in a position to be financially successful.

#### Stoicism
Determine what you can and can’t control. You can control your reactions to temptation — a lack of discipline is the antichrist to economic security. The most powerful forward-looking indicator of your financial freedom is not how much you earn, but how much you save.

Stoicism is not just about being stoic in the face of temptation. It means having good character. Succeeding in life is much easier if other people want you to succeed.

#### Time
“Time is the fire in which we burn,” says the poet. It is our most inflexible and valuable commodity, the one thing with which you should not be generous. Squander money, you may earn it back. Squander time, it is gone forever.

Compounding is not just a financial thing. The most important returns in life come from the compounded effects of our investments over time, whether in our finances, careers, hobbies, or relationships.

#### Diversification
Investing over the long-term pays out, but there are always dips along the way. Diversification is the kevlar that protects you — with it, bad decisions will still hurt, but they won’t prove fatal. Diversification, in other words, is your bulletproof vest.

Most of the major mistakes in investing can be distilled down to two things: not diversifying, and trading.
