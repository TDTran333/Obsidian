# Learning How to Learn by Barbara Oakley

### Take away: 
#### 1. Two modes of thinking : Focused and Diffused 
* Focused mode: Concentrated thinking. Solving problems. Narrowed down.
* Diffused mode: Relaxed thinking. Let the mind wander.
	
* Good sleep, exercice and social environment helps learning. 
* Distraction occupy your mind and make learning slower. Turn them off.

#### 2. The Pomodoro Technique (Procrastination Solution) 
* Procrastination comes from anxiety caused from stress when learning new things or doing something. The brain seeks something else more pleasant to stop the negative feeling.
* Procrastination is easy to fall to. Willpower is hard to come by.
* The more you procrastinate, the harder it'll be to fend off the pain from starting work.
* The trick to beat that feeling of incomfort is to just start the task. The unpleasant feeling will go away.
* The underlying principles of Pomodoro. 
	* Break down tasks into more manageable pieces.
	* Start the task.
	* Focused intervals.
	* Remove distraction.
	* Clear finish line.
	* Breaks help refresh the brain.
* Setting up good habits helps beat procrastination.

Habits have four components
* The cue: The trigger that make you go into zombie mode. Usually, depends on environment or feelings.
* The routine: The sets of action that you do in reaction to the cue.
* The reward: The habit exist because there is a psychological reward. Neurological cravings.
* The belief: The underlying belief that keeps the habit going.
	

#### 3. Understanding with practice and repetition
* Learning gets easier with practice.
* Master the major idea first. Then go deeper. Big picture before details.
* Donâ€™t always trust your initial intuition. Sometime unlearning old ideas and approaches is needed.
* Cramming information is inefficient learning.
* Repeat reviews over time is the best way to build and strengthen the synaptic connections. Spaced repetition.

#### 4. Illusion of competence in learning and the power of recall
* Try to solve the problem myself. Watching or reading a solution does not mean that I understand or know how to solve it. 
* Test yourself often. This insure that you really understand instead of thinking you do.
* Balance my studies. Deliberatly practice more difficult stuff. Not just the easy stuff.
* Recalling mentally without looking at the material is more effective than rereading.
* Chunking or grouping concepts makes information easier to access
* Transfer of knowledge. Mastery in some area helps learn other new area.
