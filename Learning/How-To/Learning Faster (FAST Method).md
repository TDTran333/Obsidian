# Learning Faster (FAST Method)
##### Forget
* Forget what you already know about subject, start with a beginner's mind
##### Active
* Take notes and ask questions. The brain learns through creation.
##### State 
* All learning is state dependent. Information + Emotion = Long term memory.
##### Teach
* Learn as if you need to teach it to someone else. ELI5. Teach = Learn twice.
