# Six Strategies for Effective Learning
### Summary
* Ask, explain and connect
* No cramming
* Switch
* Words and visuals
* Examples
* Words and visuals
* Recall what you know

##### Elaboration
* Explain and describe ideas in many detail.
	* Ask yourself questions while studying about why and how things work
	* Find answers in study materials or search online
	* Discuss with people and ask about their views
	* Make connections between differents ideas to explain how they work together
	* Compare similarities and differences betweens two ideas
	* Relate to your own experiences or memories
	* Make sure the way you explain or describe the idea is accurate

##### Spaced Practice.
* Space out your studying over time.
	* Set aside some time every day.
	* Take a break after learning before reviewing.
	* Revisit and review important older materials over time.
	* Use effective study strategies instead of just re-reading your notes.
	* Combine with retrieval practices.

##### Interleaving
* Switch between ideas while you study.
	* Don't study one idea for too long.
	* Go back over the ideas in different order to strengthen your understanding.
	* Make links between different ideas as you switch between them.
	* Don't switch too often and make sure to spend enough time working on each idea.
	* Make sure you understand the ideas.

##### Dual Coding
* Combine words and visuals.
	* Find visuals and compare to the words.
	* Look at visuals and explain in your own words what they mean.
	* Take information you are learning and draw visuals to go along with it
	* Try to come up with different ways to represent the information visually
	* Draw what you know from memory

##### Concrete Examples
* Use specific examples to understand abstract ideas.
	* Collect examples in materials or find examples while studying
	* Make the link between the idea you are studying the examples and how they apply
	* Share examples and explain them
	* Make sure the examples are correct

##### Retrieval Practice
* Practice bringing information to mind.
	* Put away your notes and try to write everything you know by memory.
	* Check your material for accuracy and important points you missed.
	* Test yourself frequently.
	* Makes flashcards.
