# Note-Taking Methods

## 1. The Outline method

Structure notes in form of an outline by using bullet points to represent different topics and their subtopics.

>Main topic 1N
>* Sub-topic 1
>	* Key fact or thought
>* Sub-topic 2
>	* Key fact or thought
> ...

Ideal when there is a relatively clear structure.

* Not suitable for some topics
* Reviewing might be harder if bullet points are not detailed enough

## 2. The Cornell Method

| ---------- |:---------------:| ----------------------------------------- |
| Left side  |  less than 1/3  | Cue/Recall column: Main ideas / Questions |
| Right side | remaining space | Notes Column: Main notes / Key thoughts   |

## 4: The Mapping Method

Generate linked nodes from the main idea at the center outward to other concepts and establish relationships between the various ideas with arrows and symbols.

Ideal for visualising connected topics and ideas.

```mermaid
classDiagram
Main_idea --* topic_2 : related to
Main_idea --|> topic_3 : caused
topic_3 --> topic_2 : impacted
topic_4 --|> Main_idea : helped
topic_5 <-- Main_idea : generated
topic_6 <-- Main_idea : lead to
```
