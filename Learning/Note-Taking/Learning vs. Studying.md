The words learn and study are closely related to each other. Learn means "to gain knowledge or skill by studying" and study means "to read, memorize facts, attend school, etc."

When you study something, you have not learned it yet. When you are studying something, you are reading books or articles about something you do not know a lot about yet, or using flash cards to memorize facts, or listening to a teacher in a classroom, or watching videos about something so that you can know something or do something well.

When you learn something, you make it part of the things you know. When you know a lot about a subject, or are very skillful or knowledgeable about something, you have learned it.
