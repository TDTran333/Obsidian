## Just put down random ideas and organize later 

### Creating a note taking template

What are the base info I need in each note?

### Stuff I need to organize better

Images names
Better folder organization
Folders and sub-folders? or only one level
Limit the amount of folders
Make it easy and user-friendly
Focus on presentation

### How to organize my thinking better?

Basically, I need to create a **system**
Do not make it complicated
Don't allow fiction to slow down data entry
Make it my main knowledge tool

### What's the goal of my system?

Manage knowledge
Take notes
Active recall
Active learning
Link notes
Generate presentations faster
Collect information
Organize information
Distribute information
Productivity tool

### What else?

Basically, I need to consider this or any future system as a Digital Library where I can pull information easely and effortlessly

The key point are that it is easy to use, informative and easy to update

I need to organize by subject, topics, related topics etc
Create new notes when they become too big
Keep simple separate unique ideas for each note
It should make sense to me but to others too
I need to write as if I explain things to someone
Explain to a kid, explain to a regular person, explain to an expert
So have different levels and have sources

### What are the resources I can look at to help improve my system?

I don't have the time to reinvent the wheels
I need to find what work best for me but assimilating information
Keep what I would consider useful for my life
Discard everything else

End of the day, I want to be productive, efficient and knowledgeable
I want to incorporate the system in my work and my daily life

### What are the basic starting templates I need right now?

##### I need something to organize my daily notes
They are my random thoughts
Like a bullet journal
Keep me honest and reflecting

##### I need something to organize my projects
How to link ideas
How to generate documents
How to research and summarize data
Organize work flow

##### I need something to create learning notes
I mostly care about facts
Be able to explain concepts
Be able to link concepts

##### I need to organize my programming notes
Be able to link resources
Have example of codes
Create a custom help file

### Where do I start?

I have seen three concepts so far
Zettelkasten, the box of cards
Evergreen notes, the digital forest
Wiki notes

### Back to initial question

How do I start this whole system?
What are the rules I need to create?

Do I create a home center?
A central place where I can organize and link everything
Where I can document and display how the system work

Also, is this the only tool I would use?

##### What are the tools I need?

Organize my time
Calendar
Time blocking
To-do
Organize links
Note taking
Publish
Blog

Something to organize and link them together

##### What's currently available?

Right now, what do I use?

Toggl for time management
Obsidian for note taking
Zotero/Zotfiles for research paper
Raindrop.io for link management
Google keep for quite notes on the go
Google task for some todo
Google calendar for important meeting

What else?

So in 10 minutes, I just created a skeleton of a framework
I'll let it stew and come back later

Reorganize, recreate, simplify and make it fluid
Generate a good work flow
