# System structure

I have been using Obsidian daily for the past 5 weeks. It is time to create a structure that I can mold my notes into.

Regarding what I wrote 3 weeks ago in [[Obsidian thinking v1]] and what have been done since:

- [x] I wanted to create templates
- [x] I wanted better folder organization
- [x] I wanted to better organize my thinking
- [x] I accomplished many of the goals of my system
- [ ] I haven't developped a way to learn and do active recall yet. I don't review my notes yet.
- [ ] I need to keep on improving my workflow
- [ ] The more I use the tool, the better it'll fit my needs
