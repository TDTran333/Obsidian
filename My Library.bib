This bias arises from the low signal-to-noise ratio in fund returns and the consequent low statistical power.

To capture unexpected increases in climate change concerns, we construct a Media Climate Change Concern index using climate change-related news published by major U.S. newspapers. We find a negative relationship between the firms' exposure to the Media Climate Change Concerns index and the level of the firm's greenhouse gas emission per unit of revenue. This result implies that when concerns about climate change rise unexpectedly, green firms' stock price increases, while brown firms' stock price decreases. Further, using topic modeling, we analyze which type of climate change news drives this relationship. We identify five themes that have an effect on green vs. brown stock returns. Some of those themes can be related to change in investors' expectations about the future cash-flow of green vs. brown firms, while others cannot. This result implies that the relationship between concern and green vs. brown stock returns arises from both investors updating their expectations about the future cash-flows of green and brown firms and changes in investors' sustainability taste.},

Persistence tests show that, even with the more powerful FDR technique, an investor would never have been able to select ex ante the future best-performing rules. Moreover, even in-sample, the performance is completely offset by the introduction of low transaction costs. Overall, our results seriously call into question the economic value of technical trading rules that has been reported for early periods.},

Over the original period (1975-2006), we show how reasonable adjustments to the parameter choices made by BSW and AP results in a sizeable reduction in the bias relative to AP. Over the updated period (1975-2018), we further show that the performance of the FDR improves dramatically across a large range of parameter values. Specifically, we find that the probability of misclassifying a fund with a true alpha of 2\% per year is 32\% (versus 65\% in AP). Our results, in combination with those of AP, indicate that the use of the FDR in finance should be accompanied by a careful evaluation of the underlying data generating process, especially when the sample size is small.},

The false discovery rate (FDR) is one of the most commonly used approaches for measuring and controlling error rates when performing multiple tests. Adaptive FDRs rely on an estimate of the proportion of null hypotheses among all the hypotheses being tested. This proportion is typically estimated once for each collection of hypotheses. Here, we propose a regression framework to estimate the proportion of null hypotheses conditional on observed covariates. This may then be used as a multiplication factor with the Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values, leading to a plug-in FDR estimator. We apply our method to a genome-wise association meta-analysis for body mass index. In our framework, we are able to use the sample sizes for the individual genomic loci and the minor allele frequencies as covariates. We further evaluate our approach via a number of simulation scenarios. We provide an implementation of this novel method for estimating the proportion of null hypotheses in a regression framework as part of the Bioconductor package swfdr.},

Top VC IPOs were also twice as likely to receive all-star analyst coverage and suffered twice as large negative returns upon lockup expiration. We argue that this was not a coincidence. Underwriters benefited from underpricing vis-\`a-vis allocation strategies whereas VCs gain from information momentum which allows them to cash-out at higher prices at lockup expiration. All-stars are a scarce resource underwriters allocate to their best clients (top VCs) who bring them repeat business.

Our proposed ``Risk Hypothesis'' posits that the expected negative impact of diversification on fund risk induces fund managers to endogenously select riskier investments, which in turn leads to higher performance of more diversified funds. While other channels may also be at play, we provide results that support this hypothesis for an international sample of VC funds. However, this effect is weakened when expertise is limited. The study offers implications of how VC fund managers' investment decisions are influenced by strategic portfolio considerations, which in turn affect which innovative ventures receive funding.},

If, as is often the case, experiments are underpowered, you will be wrong most of the time. This conclusion is demonstrated from several points of view. First, tree diagrams which show the close analogy with the screening test problem. Similar conclusions are drawn by repeated simulations of               t               -tests. These mimic what is done in real life, which makes the results more persuasive. The simulation method is used also to evaluate the extent to which effect sizes are over-estimated, especially in underpowered experiments. A script is supplied to allow the reader to do simulations themselves, with numbers appropriate for their own work. It is concluded that if you wish to keep your false discovery rate below 5\%, you need to use a three-sigma rule, or to insist on               p               {$\leq$}0.001.

The amount of follow-on capital raised by venture capitalists is concave with respect to current fund performance. In addition, managers with less consistent performance are slower, and less likely, to raise a follow-on fund. Venture capitalists adjust their investment strategy to balance fundraising incentives against the incentive to pursue risk provided by carried interest. The findings are consistent with models of career concerns, where an agent's compensation is designed to (partially) offset the implicit incentives created by future employment opportunities.},

  abstract = {The concept of sustainable and responsible (SR) investments expresses that every investment should be based on the SR investor's code of ethics. To a large extent the allocation of SR investments to more sustainable companies and ethical practices is based on the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) scores provided by rating agencies. However, a thorough investigation of ESG scores is a neglected topic in the literature. This paper uses Thomson Reuters ASSET4 ESG ratings to analyze the influence of firm size, a company's available resources for providing ESG data, and the availability of a company's ESG data on the company's sustainability performance. We find a significant positive correlation between the stated variables, which can be explained by organizational legitimacy. The results raise the question of whether the way the ESG score measures corporate sustainability gives an advantage to larger firms with more resources while not providing SR investors with the information needed to make decisions based on their beliefs. Due to our results, SR investors and scholars should reopen the discussion about: what sustainability rating agencies measure with ESG scores, what exactly needs to be measured, and if the sustainable finance community can reach their self-imposed objectives with this measurement.},

Our approach allows for tests with imperfect power that may falsely classify good funds as bad, and vice versa. Examining both mutual funds and hedge funds, we find smaller fractions of zero-alpha funds and more funds with abnormal performance, compared with the BSW approach. We also use the model as prior information about the cross-section of funds to evaluate and predict fund performance.},

Next, we analyze, from the point of view of the investor, which type of risk (total, systematic, and specific) should be used as the input of performance evaluation. We distinguish the normative approach, in which the investor tries to optimize her portfolio choice, with the positive approach, for which the asset allocation is supposed to be given. We also address the issue of the selection of the appropriate measure from the portfolio manager's point of view. We show that it primarily depends on the stability of rankings produced with the selected measure. Numerical illustrations of these selection criteria are provided through a simplified, yet realistic example.},

We construct a carbon risk factor-mimicking portfolio to understand carbon risk through the lens of a factor-based asset pricing model. While carbon risk explains systematic return variation well, we do not find evidence of a carbon risk premium. We show that this may be the case because of: (1) the opposing price movements of brown firms and firms becoming greener, and (2) that carbon risk is associated with unpriced cash-flow changes rather than priced discount-rate changes.

Many beat their benchmarks purely by luck. Multiple testing methods are designed to control for luck. Factor selection is another glaring case in which multiple tests are performed, but other numerous applications do not get as much attention. One important example is a simple regression model in which five variables are tested. In this case, because five variables are tried, a t-statistic of 2.0 is not enough to establish significance. Our paper provides a guide to various multiple testing methods and details a number of applications. We provide simulation evidence on the relative performance of different methods across a variety of testing environments. The goal of our paper is to provide a menu that researchers can choose from to improve inference in financial economics.},

We show that the Fama and French method suffers from an undersampling problem that leads to a failure to reject the null hypothesis of zero alpha, even when some funds generate economically large risk-adjusted returns. In contrast, Kosowski et al. avoid the undersampling problem, but substantially over reject the null hypothesis, even when all funds have a zero alpha. Hence, the truth about mutual fund performance likely lies between the two findings. We present a novel bootstrapping approach that should be useful to future researchers who are choosing between the two approaches.},

This implies ESG-friendly portfolios could underperform in `risk-on' periods \textendash{} but be more resilient in downturns. They could even outperform in the long run as flows into sustainable investment products increase and climate risks compound. New benchmarks and products are making ESG investing more accessible across asset classes and regions. Data are improving, but still patchy. This means it is critical to go beyond headline ESG scores for insights. Understanding how and why individual score components can affect returns is key. This can differ across regions, industries and companies. Our confidence in ESG as a potential source of alpha is rising, but there is still work to be done. Early evidence suggests that focusing on ESG may pay the greatest dividends in emerging markets (EMs). Issues such as shareholder protections, natural resources management and labour relations can be important performance differentiators in the emerging world. A new suite of ESG-friendly EM debt indices could help steer more capital into ESG leaders over time \textendash{} and incentivise laggards to lift their game. BlackRock is engaging with companies on sustainability issues, not to impose our own values, but to advocate for ESG excellence on behalf of clients.

However, this form of investment has been hampered by the unclear relationship between corporate environmental performance and financial performance. To address this, this study empirically investigates the risk-return relationship of low-carbon investment and characteristics of carbon-efficient firms. Based on 74,486 observations of 736 US firms from January 2005 to December 2015, we construct a carbon efficient-minus-inefficient (EMI) portfolio by carbon efficiency, defined as revenue-adjusted greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the firm-level. Our EMI portfolio generates positive abnormal returns since 2010 and an investment strategy of "long carbon-efficient firms and short carbon-inefficient firms" would earn abnormal returns of 3.5-5.4\% per year. The only exception is found in small firms. We find that these carbon-efficient firms tend to be "good firms'' in terms of financial characteristics and corporate governance. Our findings are not driven by a small set of industries, variations in oil price, or changing preferences of bond investors caused by the low-interest-rate regime, starting with the 2008 financial crisis.},

However, early stage startups in emerging industry contexts tend to have few good signals upon which to rely. Public agencies can play a valuable role in this process, but prior research has not sufficiently examined how startups effectively leverage this support. In this paper, therefore, we develop a framework to investigate the role that signals can play for early stage startups when they win prestigious government research grants. We test this framework in the setting of the emerging U.S. clean energy sector and find that in comparison to a matched sample of clean energy startups that have not won prestigious research grants, startups with these grants were 12\% more likely to acquire subsequent venture capital (VC) funding. Another significant result is that the value of this signaling is greater for startups that have fewer patents. The important contribution of this finding is that it shows that signaling has the potential to redistribute benefits rather than just provide an additional accrual of advantages to the already high status actors. Together these results highlight the advantages for startups in emerging industries of pursuing signaling strategies with public agencies when they attempt to make important transitions through the stages of their organizational life cycles.},

Because achieving success with CER investing is often a long-term process, we maintain that by effectively investing in CER, executives can decrease their firms' environmental costs, thereby enhancing operating performance. By employing a unique environmental data set covering 29 countries, we find that the lowering of environmental costs takes at least one or two years before enhancing return on assets (ROA). We also find that lowering environmental costs has a more immediate and substantial effect on the performance of financial services firms in well-developed financial markets than in less-developed financial markets. These results are economically and statistically significant and robust even after alleviating endogeneity and using an additional performance measure. We interpret our empirical results as supporting the social impact and reputation-building hypothesis. Our findings also suggest that policy makers dealing with corporate sustainability management should pursue an environment-centered industry policy not only at the manufacturing sector but also at the financial services sector, as firms in both sectors with lower environmental costs perform better.},

  abstract = {Background: In high-throughput studies, hundreds to millions of hypotheses are typically tested. Statistical methods that control the false discovery rate (FDR) have emerged as popular and powerful tools for error rate control. While classic FDR methods use only p values as input, more modern FDR methods have been shown to increase power by incorporating complementary information as informative covariates to prioritize, weight, and group hypotheses. However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another. We investigate the accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six modern FDR-controlling methods by performing a systematic benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case studies in computational biology. Results: Methods that incorporate informative covariates are modestly more powerful than classic approaches, and do not underperform classic approaches, even when the covariate is completely uninformative. The majority of methods are successful at controlling the FDR, with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings. Furthermore, we find that the improvement of the modern FDR methods over the classic methods increases with the informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses. Conclusions: Modern FDR methods that use an informative covariate provide advantages over classic FDR-controlling procedures, with the relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of available covariates. We present our findings as a practical guide and provide recommendations to aid researchers in their choice of methods to correct for false discoveries.},

Based on a sample of 235 new ventures drawn from a unique dataset combining multiple sources, we examine the signals of founders' human capital (i.e., education, industry experience, and founding experience) and investor prominence and their influence on the amount of external funding received across two stages of venture funding. We find that founders' founding experience and education have the greatest effects for acquiring first-round financing, but in later stages, only the signaling effect from education remains. Furthermore, we find important interactions between founders' human capital and investor prominence in the second round of funding. By utilizing lagged funding information, we show that different types of signals have a dynamic and temporal impact on new ventures' resource acquisition, including the persistence of some signals and the temporariness of others.},

Unfortunately, this test is not valid when returns have tails heavier than the normal distribution or are of time series nature. Instead, we propose the use of robust inference methods. In particular, we suggest to construct a studentized time series bootstrap confidence interval for the difference of the Sharpe ratios and to declare the two ratios different if zero is not contained in the obtained interval. This approach has the advantage that one can simply resample from the observed data as opposed to some null-restricted data. A simulation study demonstrates the improved finite sample performance compared to existing methods. In addition, two applications to real data are provided.},

  abstract = {In multiple-testing problems, where a large number of hypotheses are tested simultaneously, false discovery rate (FDR) control can be achieved with the well-known Benjamini\textendash Hochberg procedure, which adapts to the amount of signal in the data, under certain distributional assumptions. Many modifications of this procedure have been proposed to improve power in scenarios where the hypotheses are organized into groups or into a hierarchy, as well as other structured settings. Here we introduce the `structure-adaptive Benjamini\textendash Hochberg algorithm' (SABHA) as a generalization of these adaptive testing methods. The SABHA method incorporates prior information about any predetermined type of structure in the pattern of locations of the signals and nulls within the list of hypotheses, to reweight the p-values in a data-adaptive way. This raises the power by making more discoveries in regions where signals appear to be more common. Our main theoretical result proves that the SABHA method controls the FDR at a level that is at most slightly higher than the target FDR level, as long as the adaptive weights are constrained sufficiently so as not to overfit too much to the data\textemdash interestingly, the excess FDR can be related to the Rademacher complexity or Gaussian width of the class from which we choose our data-adaptive weights. We apply this general framework to various structured settings, including ordered, grouped and low total variation structures, and obtain the bounds on the FDR for each specific setting. We also examine the empirical performance of the SABHA method on functional magnetic resonance imaging activity data and on gene\textendash drug response data, as well as on simulated data.},

The solution to the investor's portfolio problem is characterized by an ESG-efficient frontier, showing the highest attainable Sharpe ratio for each ESG level. The corresponding portfolios satisfy four-fund separation. Equilibrium asset prices are determined by an ESG-adjusted capital asset pricing model, showing when ESG increases or lowers the required return. Combining several large data sets, we compute the empirical ESG-efficient frontier and show the costs and benefits of responsible investing. Finally, we test our theory's predictions using proxies for E (carbon emissions), S, G, and overall ESG.},

It aims to provide quantitative input to the portfolio construction process at Handelsbanken Fonder, by applying Konno \& Yamazaki's Mean Absolute Deviation method, with a Feinstein \& Thapa modification. Additionally, the Black-Litterman model is implemented to approximate the input of expected return. The linear optimization problem was then solved by the Simplex algorithm. The main deliverable is a model that can assist portfolio managers in making investment decisions. Back-testing of the model showed that it did not outperform the benchmark portfolios, which is likely a result of only allowing long positions in the model. Nevertheless, the model provides value by giving the user a second opinion on the e cient frontier, for any given investment decision.},

B 57(1):289\textendash 300, 1995) provide a method for controlling the FDR based on p-values for each of the null hypotheses under the assumption that the p-values are independent. Subsequent research has since shown that this procedure is valid under weaker assumptions on the joint distribution of the p-values. Related procedures that are valid under no assumptions on the joint distribution of the p-values have also been developed. None of these procedures, however, incorporate information about the dependence structure of the test statistics. This paper develops methods for control of the FDR under weak assumptions that incorporate such information and, by doing so, are better able to detect false null hypotheses. We illustrate this property via a simulation study and two empirical applications. In particular, the bootstrap method is competitive with methods that require independence if independence holds, but it outperforms these methods under dependence.},

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

Specifically, it covers and categorizes 314 articles that have appeared in top leading international journals since 2011 and points to areas that deserve deeper investigation. 67.8\% of these works deal exclusively with VC and 26.8\% deal exclusively with PE. The main ``hot'' topics in VC and PE research are: (1) heterogeneity (e.g., in affiliation, experience, reputation) within the VC and PE industries and its effects, (2) the causal link between VC and PE financing and various aspects of company performance, such as growth or innovation, (3) the performance of VC and PE funds and how to measure it properly. In the literature on VC, (4) internationalization and (5) the processes through which VC investors and entrepreneurs select and match with each other are also highly relevant topics. Most recent works (81.2\%) are empirical and strategies that aim at identifying causal effects have been getting widespread. Although new sources of data have been used and the European (and to a lesser extent Asian) VC and PE industries have been gaining ground in recent research, more than 52\% of all empirical papers still rely on US data.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, and particularly over the last several years, there has been a dramatic increase in ESG investing strategies. That has coincided with robust economic and market performance in the U.S. New research examines whether strong ESG returns are likely to be tied to a strong economy and market.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we discuss four models proposed by Konno, Cai, Teo and Markowitz respectively. Two groups of data (one from 33 securities over 72 months, the other from 63 securities over 120 months) are used to examine these models. Efficient frontiers are presented. The utility levels in the four models do not decrease at the same rate with the change of the risk-aversion factor. Cai's model provides the highest utility value and Markowitz's provides the lowest one in most cases. When the expected returns are confronted with the true ones at the end of a 10-month period, Markowitz's and Konno's models seem to have similar tendencies while Cai's and Teo's models seem to have similar tendencies, and the four models get higher true wealth compared with Nikkei 225 and Nikkei 500 index respectively in most cases.},

  abstract = {This paper shows how sustainable investing affects asset returns through exclusionary screening and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) integration. I develop an asset pricing model with partial segmentation and heterogeneous preferences. I characterize two taste premia that clarify the relationship between ESG and financial performance and two exclusion premia generalizing Merton (1987)'s premium on neglected stocks. By using the holdings of 453 green funds investing in U.S. stocks between 2007 and 2019 to proxy for sustainable investors' tastes, I estimate the model applied to green investing and sin stock exclusion. The annual taste effect ranges from -1.12\% to +0.14\% for the different industries and the average exclusion effect is 1.43\%.},
