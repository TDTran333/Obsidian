# Formula One - Drive to Survive

### Season 1
##### E1: All to Play For
[Red Bull Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing "Red Bull Racing") driver [Daniel Ricciardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo "Daniel Ricciardo") prepares himself for the [opening race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Australian_Grand_Prix "2018 Australian Grand Prix") of what he believes to be the most important season of his career. A penalty in qualifying makes his race more difficult, and he goes on to finish fourth. Meanwhile [Haas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_F1_Team "Haas F1 Team") enjoy their strongest qualifying to date, but their race ends in heartbreak when mistakes in the pits mean both their drivers retire.

##### E2: The King of Spain
[Carlos Sainz Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr. "Carlos Sainz Jr.") reflects on the opening races of the season, his ongoing battles with his idol [Fernando Alonso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso "Fernando Alonso") and life as the son of [a World Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz "Carlos Sainz"). He secures a career-best result in [Azerbaijan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix "2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix"), and prevails over Alonso in the [Spanish Grand Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Spanish_Grand_Prix "2018 Spanish Grand Prix"). Red Bull Racing team principal [Christian Horner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner "Christian Horner") must deal with the fallout from a collision between Ricciardo and team-mate [Max Verstappen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen "Max Verstappen") in Azerbaijan that takes both drivers out of contention.

##### E3: Redemption
Ricciardo enters the [Monaco Grand Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2018 Monaco Grand Prix") weekend questioning his future with Red Bull. An accident in free practice means that Verstappen is unable to qualify and starts the race from last place. Ricciardo qualifies on pole and leads the early stages of the race, but an engine failure leaves him down on power. He ultimately withstands pressure from [Ferrari's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari "Scuderia Ferrari") [Sebastian Vettel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel "Sebastian Vettel") to win. Meanwhile, [Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_F1 "Williams F1") struggle with a poor run of results as they fall further down the grid.

##### E4: The Art of War
Horner becomes embroiled in a war of words with [Renault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_in_Formula_One "Renault in Formula One") team principal [Cyril Abiteboul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Abiteboul "Cyril Abiteboul") over their engine supply. Horner is unhappy with Renault's performance and reliability, while Abiteboul pushes back against Horner's public criticism. Horner ultimately decides to end the relationship with Renault and join [Honda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_in_Formula_One "Honda in Formula One") in [2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship "2019 Formula One World Championship"). Feeling that Red Bull are favouring Verstappen and that Honda are still unproven, Ricciardo decides to leave the team and join Renault in 2019. Although Horner publicly supports him, Ricciardo begins to feel isolated within the team. Meanwhile, Ricciardo's contract with Renault means that Sainz Jr. is without a drive in 2019.

##### E5: Trouble at the Top
In the build-up to the [British Grand Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_British_Grand_Prix "2018 British Grand Prix"), [McLaren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren "McLaren") and [Force India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_India "Force India") face very different problems. McLaren team principal [Eric Boullier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Boullier "Eric Boullier") resigns over the team's poor performance, leaving CEO [Zak Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Brown "Zak Brown") to try and rebuild the team whilst they struggle with [an uncompetitive car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MCL33 "McLaren MCL33"). [Force India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_India "Force India") team principal [Vijay Mallya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_Mallya "Vijay Mallya") tries to deal with legal problems stemming from the collapse of [his airline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingfisher_Airlines "Kingfisher Airlines") in 2013. The race sees Force India's [Esteban Ocon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon "Esteban Ocon") beat both McLarens, while [Sergio Pérez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez "Sergio Pérez") is caught up in a first-corner accident. The result sees Force India take sixth place from McLaren in the [World Constructors' Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Constructors%27_Champions "List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions"), but three weeks later the team is put into [administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_(law) "Administration (law)").
