# Data Visualization vs. Infographic

**Infographics** tell a premeditated story to guide the audience to conclusions (subjective). 
**Data visualizations** let the audience draw their own conclusions (objective).

### Infographics
Infographics, literally information plus graphics, are visual representations of information, data, or knowledge. They present complex information quickly and clearly – and often, tell a story.

Infographics are:

* Best for telling a premeditated story and offer subjectivity
* Best for guiding the audience to conclusions and point out relationships

### Data visualizations
Data visualization is the study of visual representation of data – i.e. using graphics to make sense of large amounts of data or information, especially in science and academics.

Data visualizations are:

* Best for allowing the audience to draw their own conclusions, and offer objectivity
* Ideal for understanding data at a glance

An infographic can contain data visualizations but not the other way around.

| Complexity                                          | Generally quite simple, targeting a layman audience                           | Vary greatly in complexity, from simple bar charts to highly complex scientific visualizations                                                                         |
| Includes narrative or storytelling                  | Usually                                                                       | No (this is external to the visualization)                                                                                                                             |
| Design and aesthetics                               | Often a lot of work goes into the design and making it aesthetically pleasing | These are for the most part automatically generated using Excel or programming languages; if published or used in presentations, more attention is paid to the design. |
| Includes meta data, e.g. units, source, definitions | Sometimes                                                                     | Generally considered to be external to the data visualization (and often excluded)                                                                                     |
| Includes graphics, clipart                          | Generally yes, to add visual appeal and provide more "oomph"                  | Sometimes included, but generally frowned upon by data visualization specialists as "chartjunk"                                                                        |
| Interactive                                         | Rarely, infographics are normally static images.                              | Increasingly so in web-based data visualizations                                                                                                                       |
| Time taken to complete                              | Generally quite time consuming                                                | Typically very little time; even interactive data visualizations can be automatically produced                                                                         |
